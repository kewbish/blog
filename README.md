# Yours, Kewbish - A companion blog üñãÔ∏è
Started in February 2020, maintained and currently posting whenever.  
Find a problem with the site? Please open an issue.  

## What I learned - üìö
I've been looking into static site generators for a while, and I've seen Jekyll and Gatsby as some of the more prominent ones. However, I chose [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) due to its ease of install and theme documentation.  
This blog also features:
- An RSS feed
- The beginnings of a CD loop
- A custom Hugo theme

## Theme Usage
This website operates on a custom handwritten Hugo theme.  
Check it out, and if you'd like a copy of the theme, get in touch with me over Discord (@kewbish#2255) or [email](mailto:kewbish@gmail.com). I'm open to any personal, non-commercial usage of the theme, but I'd like to keep tabs on who's authorized to use it.  
If you'd like to use the theme for commercial purposes, please [email](mailto:kewbish@gmail.com) me, and I'll get in touch to consider your project.  

Please check the [blog](https://kewbish.github.io/blog) out, and subscribe to the RSS feed if you'd like!
