      <description>On the vestiges of HTML.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>July 13th last week was <a href="https://html.energy">HTML Day 2024</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. HTML Day is a community-organized event where folks gather around the world to freewrite HTML. The meetups seem to take place generally in parks or beaches (so no Internet access) with fun prompts like &ldquo;make a website inspired by the sounds you hear&rdquo; or &ldquo;make a website inspired by your favourite, lesser-known element&rdquo;. Some folks even handwrite their HTML — note that the event descriptions state to bring a &ldquo;HTML-writing device&rdquo; or &ldquo;something to write HTML on&rdquo; and not &ldquo;a laptop&rdquo;. The intent is less of a &ldquo;Google all the things and make a technically challenging website&rdquo; and more of a &ldquo;go back to the roots of raw HTML and have fun&rdquo; vibe.</p>
<p>I was planning to go to my local HTML Day as well, but it was a bit of a transit trek. By the time I&rsquo;d gotten to one of my transfers, I decided just to head to a library and have my own little HTML day instead. Armed with a slice of surprisingly high-quality carrot cake from a cafe nearby, I sat down for an afternoon to hack away.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d originally come up with some slightly cursed ideas with raw CSS: building a Shamir Secret Sharing tool with server-generated CSS files that could be recombined to regenerate the secret was my initial plan. I&rsquo;d also thought about making some kind of HTML emoji canvas with <a href="https://github.com/knobiknows/all-the-bufo">bufo emojis</a> as a little puppet show. Going back to my <a href="https://kewbi.sh/blog/posts/211031/">spaced-repetition enjoyer roots</a>, making a CSS-based Leitner system was on the list as well. I wondered if I could somehow rig up a hash function in CSS to get to a sort of blockchain, and I considered using CSS as an API as <a href="https://css-tricks.com/custom-properties-as-state/">mentioned in this CSS Tricks post</a>. However, these ideas all hinged around <a href="https://kewbi.sh/blog/posts/240303/">abusing</a> CSS instead of HTML. It&rsquo;s the one thing about HTML Day: HTML is supposed to be the star of the show.</p>
<p>I was feeling pretty uninspired at some point, so I looked to the <a href="https://html.energy/">html.energy</a> page for past event prompts. I found a <a href="https://d2w9rnfcy7mm78.cloudfront.net/22595115/original_569f17680cabc94a7555a7d764e94232.jpg?1688960301?bc=0">pic in their event gallery</a> that mentioned finding a lesser used HTML element and making a page around that, and I started thinking of older, retro (to me) tags like <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code>. They&rsquo;re what I think about when I imagine the Internet of the 90s/00s (please keep in mind I was not around for said Internet era): the &ldquo;the more I know&rdquo;-esque, Neocities-core, loud and gaudy and interactive pages. I don&rsquo;t know if these tags were ubiquitous then, but they&rsquo;re pretty well-used now by tongue-in-cheek people looking to recreate that aesthetic.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, they&rsquo;re also deprecated. In particular, <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> isn&rsquo;t even implemented in modern browsers anymore — it has to be recreated via a CSS animation. I started thinking of other tags that had seen better days and were no longer implemented, and I set out on a quest to find the weirdest tags that I&rsquo;d never heard of and bring them back to life via a little extra CSS or JS. I started envisioning a circus with a freak show of resurrected tags brought back from the dead, but not quite behaving the same way: think PT Barnum crossed with Frankenstein.</p>
<p>The result was <code>1pt bar&lt;number&gt;'s travelling circus: html element freak show'</code> — an ASCII-art heavy little page showing off a few freaks of Internet nature. In this post, I&rsquo;ll expand a little on some things I learned while making the page, both about the tags themselves and the Web in general. This post is full of links to obscure pages and jumping-off points for further reading, and I hope it&rsquo;ll spark some rabbitholes of your own!</p>

<h2 id="blink-twice-and-youll-miss-it"><code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> Twice and You&rsquo;ll Miss It</h2>
<p>The <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> tag used to, as may be obvious, blink text. According to <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3015408/saying-goodbye-to-the-html-tag">this article by Fast Company</a>, it was the result of a joke turned challenge: engineers working on <a href="https://lynx.invisible-island.net/">Lynx</a> were laughing at some of their wilder ideas for the browser, seeing as it couldn&rsquo;t even blink text. One of the engineers took this as a dare, and returned the next morning with a working blinking tag. It was never standardized, and few browsers supported it, but up until 2013, Firefox supported it, and Google&rsquo;s WebKit fork was even named after it. There was also a <code>text-decoration: blink</code> CSS declaration available, but it&rsquo;s also deprecated and usually not supported.</p>
<p>One reason for its removal seems to have been accessibility concerns: the blinking makes it hard to read text and could potentially trigger seizures for those with epilepsy. But the other reason cited is its lack of standardization.</p>
<p>Part of the beauty of the web is standardization: for the most part, you can trust that things will render the same across browsers. However, there&rsquo;ll always be little differences, even in well-specified standards — how else would we be able to do browser fingerprinting even without user agent headers? It makes sense that browsers would want to reduce extra surface area for divergence and focus on the specification, especially since you can recreate its functionality with the rest of the standard.</p>
<p>To implement the blinking eye on the page, I used a looping CSS animation that would toggle <code>visibility: hidden</code> on and off. <code>visibility: hidden</code> differs from <code>display: none</code> in that it keeps the element&rsquo;s block present, so it doesn&rsquo;t shift around on the page, but stops rendering the element itself.</p>
<h2 id="keygen-and-early-web-auth"><code>&lt;keygen&gt;</code> and Early-Web Auth</h2>
<p>The <code>&lt;keygen&gt;</code> element was used to generate a public/private keypair to be used in forms to validate the server&rsquo;s response (yes, back when PHP was all the rage!) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhGVPriid58">Here&rsquo;s a video I found of the tag</a>: the &lsquo;High Grade&rsquo; refers to the strength of encryption via the length of the generated key. <a href="https://www.wufoo.com/html5/keygen-element/">This page</a> lists 2048 as the &lsquo;High Grade&rsquo; encryption, which isn&rsquo;t nearly as low as I thought considering the feature was implemented well before 2016.</p>
<p>When a form containing a <code>&lt;keygen&gt;</code> had its submit handler called, a public/private keypair would be generated locally. The private key would be kept local, and the public key sent to the server and signed by the server&rsquo;s own certificate to create the client&rsquo;s certificate. This was later used to authenticate the user. Most (then-) modern browsers implemented <code>&lt;keygen&gt;</code>, including Netscape, where it originated, Opera, Firefox, and Safari, and the feature was used in quite a few places, including in early online banking. However, IE notably decided not to support the feature, which might have led to its eventual decline, deprecation, and <a href="https://github.com/w3c/html/issues/43">removal from the HTML standard</a>. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59289545/why-has-firefox-dropped-support-for-the-html5-keygen-tag#comment104798273_59289545">This SE comment</a> seems to imply that client certificates were all the rage before being supplanted by passwords — it makes sense, since early Internet users were likely fairly technical in order to onboard in the first place, but this demographic and thus this need for easier-to-understand auth shifted as adoption among the general public increased. There&rsquo;s a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160409081411/https://lists.whatwg.org/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/attachments/20080714/07ea5534/attachment.txt">very in-depth doc here</a> that explains a bit more of the background context.</p>
<p>If you want to really fake a <code>&lt;keygen&gt;</code> element, <a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/keygen-fake/">this blog post</a> shows you how to do it. Surprisingly, as of a few years ago when this article was published, some CAs still required the use of a <code>&lt;keygen&gt;</code> element, and their official guidance was to install and use IE11 to work around the tag&rsquo;s removal in modern browsers<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re happy just making a little <code>&lt;keygen&gt;</code> that displays an ASCII key when clicked, as I&rsquo;ve done on the page, it&rsquo;s nowhere near as complicated. I felt like using JS was a bit too easy and besides the point of HTML Day, so I made a CSS-only click handler. The TL;DR is that we can wrap the <code>&lt;keygen&gt;</code> element in a <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> with some <code>href=&quot;#target&quot;</code>, and when the <code>&lt;keygen&gt;</code> (really, the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>) is clicked, <code>#target</code> is appended to the end of the URL. Interestingly, there&rsquo;s a pseudo-element <code>:target</code> that allows you to style tags that are targetted, so I simply added a <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> with a key symbol and set that to <code>display: block</code> only when the element is targetted. The downside of this is that it&rsquo;ll jump to said target, causing a bit of a jarring visual effect, and if <code>#target</code> is removed from the URL, the key symbol no longer displays. I figured it was enough of a proof-of-concept even with these rough edges, though. This DigitalOcean post has more details <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/css-css-only-click-handler">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="dyk-theres-a-v-tag">DYK: There&rsquo;s a <code>&lt;V&gt;</code> Tag?</h2>
<p>There a few special-purpose text formatting tags like <code>&lt;big&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;center&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;s&gt;</code> (strikethrough), and <code>&lt;u&gt;</code> (underline) that were also deprecated. Scrolling down <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element">this list</a> should give you a sense of the deprecated presentational tags — look for the red trash-can icon beside each element&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p>I also wanted to call out a counterexample of these text formatting tags getting deprecated: <code>&lt;small&gt;</code>. <code>&lt;small&gt;</code> was supposed to be the counterpoint to <code>&lt;big&gt;</code>, but <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/small">isn&rsquo;t deprecated</a>. This is because of its reclassification as a semantic element: the Mozilla docs state that it&rsquo;s intended to represent copyright and legal small print, and importantly, it represents these things <em>independently of its styled presentation</em>.</p>
<p>This is exactly the reason these tags were deprecated in the first place. While these presentational tags were part of previous HTML standards, they&rsquo;ve been deprecated because they focus on the the styling of some text instead of its semantics. Note that <code>&lt;b&gt;</code>, which wraps bold text, is by default rendered the same way as <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code>. However, again, <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> marks the content just as bold, whereas <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> denotes some sort of emphasis. This gives the user the freedom to represent the semantics however they want: perhaps a user likes to see <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> text italicized in a different font instead<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re getting tired of all this deprecation and thinking &ldquo;to hell with the standard, I just want to have have presentational elements!&rdquo;, go right ahead. The proper way to create custom HTML elements is with JavaScript and the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components/Using_custom_elements">Web components API</a>. You can use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components/Using_templates_and_slots">templates and slot in your own content</a> and even <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components/Using_custom_elements#registering_a_custom_element">register it for use in HTML docs</a>. Custom elements are very powerful because they allow you to hook into different lifecycle events, like attributes changing.</p>
<p>One glaring problem with custom elements, though, is that they <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/custom-elements.html#valid-custom-element-name">must follow the standardized naming convention</a>. This forbids you from using a custom name like <code>&lt;leet&gt;</code> without a hyphen, making it obvious that you&rsquo;re using a custom element. This is fine for most (all) use cases, but for my HTML day page, I really wanted the markup to be as clean as possible and avoid relying on JS.</p>
<p>So imagine my surprise when I tried just writing <code>&lt;blah&gt;content&lt;/blah&gt;</code> and adding a simple <code>blah { color: red }</code> style and seeing the text brighten up on my screen. I didn&rsquo;t realize that browsers would parse this as valid HTML (they&rsquo;re <code>instanceof HTMLUnknownElement</code>). You can style these fake tags just as you would normal HTML tags, as long as they&rsquo;re accepted as a tag name: underscores and hyphens in the tag name work, but periods don&rsquo;t. I didn&rsquo;t look up the exact rules here, but I&rsquo;d expect you can probably find more restrictions.</p>
<p>On my HTML day page, I&rsquo;d already mentioned <code>&lt;s&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;u&gt;</code> as deprecated tags (they aren&rsquo;t, see footnote)<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>, and I just applied a little <code>text-decoration: none</code> to them to remove their strikethrough and underline respectively. I also thought it&rsquo;d be funny to round out the alphabet here, with the fictitious <code>&lt;r&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;t&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;v&gt;</code> tags. Of these, I think the <code>&lt;v&gt;</code> element is most interesting: it represents a little graffiti tag (pun not intended) that has blue Comic Sans (or whatever your browser default <code>cursive</code> font is) angled on top of the existing text. I did this via a <code>:before</code> pseudo-element: I added <code>v { position: relative }</code> and <code>v:before { position: absolute; left: 0 }</code> in order to get the pseudo-element to display directly on top of the <code>&lt;v&gt;</code>&rsquo;s content. Then, by setting the <code>:before</code>&rsquo;s <code>content</code> property, I was able to add the extra graffiti text. Finally, I added a little extra styling to rotate the text as if it&rsquo;d really been tagged onto the underlying content: I didn&rsquo;t expect transforms to work on pseudo-elements properly, but <code>transform: rotate(25deg)</code> did the trick. In retrospect, it might have been nice to add some drop shadows to make it seem like the &lsquo;paint&rsquo; was dripping, but an effect to explore for later.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I came into HTML Day intending to hack together a funny page and move on, but I&rsquo;ve been able to learn more about how Web standards have evolved and a bit more about the history of HTML. As time went on, I can see the decisions to shift responsibility from more static technologies (HTML) into more dynamic ones (CSS, JS). I&rsquo;ve always thought of these three main Web languages as all wrapped up, listed as one big slash-delimited acronym on my resume. It&rsquo;s been interesting to reflect on the patterns of deprecation and how they&rsquo;ve very intentionally decreased possibilities for doing the wrong thing while separating each language&rsquo;s responsibility more clearly.</p>
<p>At first, coming into this whole deep dive, I&rsquo;d thought that deprecating tags was more restrictive, since it was encouraging people not to use more varied and diverse elements. Now, I think culling out-of-scope tags and focusing on these very delineated responsibilities is more freeing. The example that cemented this for me was that having clearer semantics, not mixing in presentational tags, and not implementing non-standard behaviour can allow users to specify how they want to view their semantics: for example, bolding an <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> tag or listing all <code>&lt;big&gt;</code> text in a different font style. By promoting clean semantics and removing possibilities for self-contradiction within the spec, users can trust the standard, and by extension their browsers, more.</p>
<p>Besides really enjoying the history, I learned that what I&rsquo;ve learned about HTML from modern web development via React et al. hasn&rsquo;t even scratched the surface of what (raw) HTML has to offer. I&rsquo;d previously considered myself fairly well-versed in HTML and CSS, but I&rsquo;ve realized that I&rsquo;m severely lacking in more of its history and its weirder corners. It&rsquo;s nice going down a little rabbithole, since the standard is so sprawling and there&rsquo;s so much to specify: there&rsquo;s bound to be interesting edge cases.</p>
<p>This exploration also puts into scale how complex web browsers are, yet how basic an initial set of tags that covers most functionality can be. In everyday dev, I probably only use 10-15 tags, whereas there are <a href="https://devdevout.com/html/how-many-html-tags-are-there">142 defined in the HTML5.2 standard</a> and probably many more non-standard ones, like <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code>. There are books covering <a href="https://browser.engineering/">how to build your own fully-fledged browser</a>, and I&rsquo;ve been thinking of skimming it to see if I&rsquo;d find web browser internals interesting. Once I&rsquo;d learned that <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> wasn&rsquo;t implemented in modern browsers, I was considering having my HTML Day project being creating a custom fork of Chromium that automatically injected a CSS blink animation, but I figured with the time I had (and the battery, since I forgot my charger) it was something to leave for another day. It might be easier to figure out how to implement <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> with a smaller browser like the one I&rsquo;d build with browser.engineering, so I might take a look.</p>
<p>Writing this little summary and building a small site was very fun. HTML Day was a well-timed excuse to build something for the sake of building it, with some loose constraints that were a great forcing function for my creativity. I&rsquo;m excited for the next events in August for HTML&rsquo;s birthday and what I&rsquo;ll learn there. Hopefully I&rsquo;ll be able to make it in person this time — I saw some Exquisite Corpse-inspired and handwritten HTML shenanigans that&rsquo;re really making me look forward to it.</p>
<p>If you didn&rsquo;t take a stab at anything for HTML Day, I&rsquo;d encourage you to find one of the deprecated tags in this post (or one of the supported ones in <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element">this list</a>) and try to figure out the weirdest edge cases and quirkiest uses you can think of for it! What you learn might just <code>&lt;em&gt;</code>aze you.</p>

<p>As far as I can tell, July 13th isn&rsquo;t related to the history of HTML in any way, so I&rsquo;m assuming it&rsquo;s some arbitrary date picked by the organizers for people around the world to freewrite HTML.

      <description>On delivering my first conference talk, in the midst of exams.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>A few weeks ago, I posted about my first talk: a <a href="https://ossna2024.sched.com/event/1aBNC/the-github-graph-characterizing-open-source-collaboration-patterns-emilie-ma-university-of-british-columbia">session about understanding open-source collaboration patterns</a> at <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-north-america/">Open Source Summit North America 2024</a>. I also posted a separate journal entry about <a href="https://kewbi.sh/blog/posts/240602/">my day-of experience</a>, which includes some more reflections on being a first-time attendee and speaker.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d prefer to watch my talk rather than read <a href="https://kewbi.sh/blog/posts/240526/">the previous post</a> for context, here it is!</p>

<p>In this post, I wanted to list a few quick points about writing a talk that I&rsquo;d wish I&rsquo;d known before embarking on this rather harrowed adventure (to see why it was so stressful, see the <a href="https://kewbi.sh/blog/posts/240602/">previous post</a>.) It&rsquo;s by no means an exhaustive list, but I hope it&rsquo;ll be helpful to anyone in a similar boat of being incredibly busy while also prepping for a talk.</p>
<h2 id="giving-a-talk">Giving a Talk</h2>
<p>The research I presented in my talk was part of a project I&rsquo;d worked on for a Directed Studies course at university a few terms ago. As part of that course, I was required to give a final presentation summarizing my work (and in fact, I presented twice to two different labs!), so I&rsquo;d already gotten a set of slides done and a preliminary set of notes. However, that talk was primarily targetted towards my contributions to the project, the quantitative statistics and the tooling. It had a heavy focus on rather convoluted statistics and my own report as opposed to the more qualitative findings presented in the final paper. For OSSNA2024, I needed to reframe the talk for more of a general audience and highlight more of the big picture takeaways from our project.</p>
<p>In some ways, starting with an already fleshed out set of slides and a script was both a blessing and a curse. It was great to not have to start from scratch, which would have taken up valuable time, but it also lulled me into a false sense of security and made it much easier to procrastinate on making these more fundamental changes to talk pacing or structure. I applied for OSSNA2024 near the start of January, and heard back with an acceptance in February, so I had two full months to slowly chip away at these updates. Because I felt like I was so ahead of the preparation, however, I ended up only really focusing on my talk in mid-March, which didn&rsquo;t leave me with enough time to comfortably revamp the talk. I was balancing studying for finals season as well as a steady courseload, and with more urgent assignments and due dates always popping up, I kept deprioritizing talk prep and pushing it to later and later. I ended up having to pull some long, full-throttle days between when classes ended (the 11th) and my talk (the 15th), which was not ideal. I think of myself as a rather organized person who can estimate workloads and plan my time fairly well, but even I really dropped the ball on this process. If you take one thing away from this post with regards to starting public speaking for the first time, make it this: start earlier than you think, preferably right after you hear back that your talk has been accepted.</p>
<p>I worked on my script and slides in tandem: I think I speak better when I have a set of rehearsed sentences. I don&rsquo;t do well with just bullet points: I end up either reciting them, stammering while trying to find the right verb, or repeating the same adjectives and verbs over and over. The talk writing process was a cycle of adding a few sentences or a paragraph to my script, adding them to my slides, coming up with a visual, setting up animations, and repeating. I memorized my script (not as well as I&rsquo;d like) by repeating it over and over to myself until I knew the cadence and connections between slides. I&rsquo;d set aside half an hour each day to practice with just the script. Some days, I&rsquo;d take my after-dinner break or lunch break to rehearse as well: my friends once saw me pacing in circles in the hallway outside our club room muttering points to myself for an hour and were genuinely concerned if I was alright. In hindsight, I should have started practicing the script earlier with the slides, since it took some time to get the cues for animations and points right. The first few times I tried speaking with the slides, it felt very unnatural trying to juggle recalling my lines while trying to predict slide transitions.</p>
<p>Something I severely underestimated was how important the structure and the pacing of a talk was. I knew the gist of the raw information I wanted to impart, but it was only after several rounds of feedback from my professors that the talk started feeling more natural instead of like it was jumping all over the place. For example, I&rsquo;d previously put methodology at the end, since I thought people were more interested in what we were presenting than how we got that information. Later, I realized that sharing the &ldquo;how&rdquo; created valuable context for understanding the &ldquo;what&rdquo; and as per one of my professors&rsquo; suggestions, I moved it near the start of the talk. I also spent a lot of slides at the beginning reiterating various features of GitHub, which sluggishly dragged out the start, especially since the attendees were all open-source enthusiasts and would most probably already use GitHub. As well, my talk was covering collaboration patterns on GitHub, so we&rsquo;d created a list of these prototypical workflow types. Since I wanted to share as much information about our project as possible, I initially included summaries of all nine. After reading my talk out loud a few times and after feedback from my supervisors, I realized that it&rsquo;d be painful, but I&rsquo;d have to cut some of them out. Repetitive, overly detailed deep-dives into a topic aren&rsquo;t amenable to a shorter talk: listeners start tuning out after the first few points that appear similar at first glance but differ in super minute ways. Don&rsquo;t linger on any one section too long — try to divide your talk into roughly equally sized chunks for each subtopic. I think it&rsquo;s easier to keep people engaged when you cover a wider variety of material at a medium level of detail, particularly if some of that information is implications or real-world examples of the initial theory.</p>
<p>I did all my slide design in Figma. I wrote a little post about my experiences using Figma for presentations <a href="https://kewbi.sh/blog/posts/231231/">here</a> if you&rsquo;re interested in the general workflow. On top of that post, I&rsquo;d like to add that while Figma makes it very easy to design and share visually-appealing slides, the presentation workflow for serious talks is very much lacking. If you want speaker notes that are synced to the slides, you&rsquo;ll have to use comments, read from the tiny sidebar, open up two tabs, and use the follow cursor option: not a great experience. I ended up just memorizing my speaker notes and running from memory and the slides, but it would have been a nice safety net for my first ever talk.</p>
<p>On the topic of slide design, remember to visually highlight the key points you&rsquo;re making orally. For example, I tended to click through a series of bullet points talking about a graph without pointing out what part of the figure the point was referring to (e.g. &rsquo;the isolated nodes&rsquo; → should change the colour of or otherwise point out the bar chart for the &lsquo;size 1&rsquo; nodes) I would also sometimes make summarizing statements or talk about implications without writing them down on the slide, as I felt they were natural conclusions to draw from the rest of the points on the screen. It&rsquo;s helpful to make these TL;DR lines explicit, though, and I got a lot of head-nodding and sneaky-phone-camera-picture-taking when I clicked into one of these points.</p>
<p>One of the most helpful steps during this talk writing process was running through my talk and getting feedback on those runthroughs. If you have supervisors, mentors, or even just willing friends, it&rsquo;s very helpful to sit them down and rehearse to get a sense of how the talk <em>feels</em>, in terms of pacing, content, and depth. I recorded an early draft runthrough and shared it with my professors, who gave me plenty of valuable advice for where things felt too slow or where things needed more highlighting. This is why starting early is also so critical: more time means more runthroughs and more actionable improvements between runthroughs. I really wanted to present this talk to my friends to see what they&rsquo;d think of it and if they could follow it, since they come from an earlier stage in their career and have less exposure to open source, but I ran out of time.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s still a lot I need to learn with regards to architecting a talk, defining its purpose and takeaways, finding my voice, and learning to speak with more confidence. I don&rsquo;t have a lot of experience with public speaking — I quit my school&rsquo;s debate club after one meeting — but it&rsquo;s something that I want to work on. When I envision my future career, it involves a lot of mentorship and knowledge sharing, and clear communication, particularly verbal, is a skill that&rsquo;ll aid me do that more successfully.</p>
<p>If you want more concrete advice on writing a talk, I&rsquo;d highly recommend <a href="https://mercedesbernard.com/blog/start-conf-speaking-idea/">Mercedes Bernard&rsquo;s series on conference speaking</a>. I also found <a href="https://ines.io/blog/beginners-guide-beautiful-slides-talks/">Ines Montani&rsquo;s page on making beautiful slides</a> good inspiration, though their style might be a bit over the top in some fields.</p>
<p>This will be my last OSSNA 2024 summary post, but I wanted to extend one last thank you to the organizing team and the Linux Foundation for letting me break out of my shell and give my first talk. I couldn&rsquo;t have asked for more inclusive and comfortable conference to start my public speaking career.</p>

      <description>On rescheduling a final for my first conference talk.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Last week, I posted a summary of my first talk: a <a href="https://ossna2024.sched.com/event/1aBNC/the-github-graph-characterizing-open-source-collaboration-patterns-emilie-ma-university-of-british-columbia">session about understanding open-source collaboration patterns</a> at <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-north-america/">Open Source Summit North America 2024</a>. I was able to share my work with OSS folks, meet up in-person with some people I&rsquo;d only met online, and take in all the buzz in the brand new Seattle Convention Centre. If you&rsquo;d prefer to watch my talk rather than read <a href="https://kewbi.sh/blog/posts/240526/">the previous post</a> for context, here it is!</p>

This post is a collection of little anecdotes from the day-of as well as my reflections on the overall experience. I'll briefly cover some tips on preparing for a talk in a separate post to come.


<h2 id="day-of">Day-Of</h2>
<p>Even though the conference was three days and I would&rsquo;ve had a ticket to all three, I unfortunately had a final at 8:30AM the day of my talk (the first day of the conference) and another at 7PM the day after. When I applied to speak, I was banking on the fact that my courses were upper level and smaller than the intro / 100-level courses that usually have their exams scheduled for the first few days of finals. But I was unlucky: the first day of the conference was also the first day of exam period, and I had two finals back-to-back. I was initially debating if I&rsquo;d even be able to make it to give my talk, but thankfully I was able to reschedule my talk for a later time so I&rsquo;d theoretically be able to book it from Vancouver, right after my first exam, to Seattle. And later, in another stroke of luck, I went to the professor for the first exam and successfully begged to be able to sit my exam during the final for another course they were teaching. I was incredibly surprised that there were no questions asked on his part, but I certainly wasn&rsquo;t complaining.</p>
<p>With my first exam cleared out of the way, I&rsquo;d be able to leave Vancouver in the morning of my talk and make it to Seattle by lunchtime. My parents were tagging along to sightsee in downtown Seattle, so we bundled into the car early on the 16th and headed out. On the drive there, I was trying to silently run through my talk script, but something about sitting shotgun and staring out at the highway passing by isn&rsquo;t very conducive for focus. I was aiming to run through the talk at least a few more times there. The drive was ~3h and my talk was ~30min, so I could have reasonably got through it 5-6 times, but I got through it about twice, in fits and starts. At this point, I was starting to feel uneasy and underprepared, but we were soon reaching downtown Seattle and I had to go back to navigating off the highway.</p>
<p>When I got dropped off at the venue, I was in awe. We were in the brand-new, Summit building of the Seattle Convention Centre, so there were plenty of tall ceilings, natural light, and cute seating areas. Everything was sparkling clean and impeccably professional, which perhaps I haven&rsquo;t come to expect given my typical university surroundings. It was nice feeling starry-eyed with the sunlight streaming in through the floor-to-ceiling windows, running around gawking at all the amenities, decor, and spaces. One of my favourite places in the center was this garden patio decorated with little fairy lights, outdoor wooden seating, little tree-lined pathways, and a view out into the center of downtown. It looked like something out of an IKEA late-summer-nights catalog, and I spent some time rehearsing my talk there as well as enjoying the free breakfast my second day.</p>

</p>
<p>I also really liked this seating area by the stairs: there&rsquo;s something about the impossibly high ceilings, comfy atmosphere, and just the sun that made it feel very cozy. If I sound like I&rsquo;m appreciating the sun a lot, it&rsquo;s because we 1) weren&rsquo;t getting this type of sun in Vancouver and 2) in UBC there are few spaces that capture the light so well. The warm tones of the wood and the sun made even the shadowier sections look inviting.</p>

<p>When I arrived, I spent some time walking around the sponsor showcase. I&rsquo;d never been to a conference before and was surprised at the level of detail and theming that went into some of these flagship booths. AWS&rsquo;s booth was themed like a 90s diner, complete with the bar stools and a retro menu remixing AWS services and tools into burgers. There was even a little window where someone was manning a cookie giveaway (only after you&rsquo;d listened to their spiel, of course). The Gitbook stand had a barista, and the Microsoft booth had one of the largest flatscreens I&rsquo;d ever seen. There were old arcade game cabinets and carnival-style games: I saw a massive Jenga set and gingerly took a piece out for the fun of it. I was accosted by someone shoving an iPad in my face and promising me a Starbucks gift card for filling out a survey on how I perceived their company&rsquo;s open source strategy (which I indeed did, if not more out of confusion than anything else).</p>
<p>Initially, I was seeking internship leads, but I quickly realized most of the folks were there to sell the product and would just redirect me to the careers page. Alas, I&rsquo;d wasted ten printed copies of my resume for nothing. In preparation for the event, I&rsquo;d also bought a <a href="https://nfcring.com/">NFC Ring</a> so I&rsquo;d be able to share my website and contact information in a unique and hopefully memorable way. No one asked me for my information at the event, so I didn&rsquo;t have the chance to show off my very sleek titanium business card ring<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>After killing time for a bit, I met up with the program manager for one of the experiences that&rsquo;s changed my life. (I&rsquo;m being vague in case they don&rsquo;t want to be identified) I&rsquo;d only ever met them online, and they introduced me to some of their colleagues at the event. I also met the former Director of Open Source at the company that hosted said impactful event, which was pretty fun. I didn&rsquo;t do too much networking besides this, though, which is something I perhaps regret not taking advantage of.</p>
<p>One thing the PgM mentioned to me was that conference food is always not great — they&rsquo;d gone out for dimsum for a work lunch instead of taking the catering. I found this to be unfortunately kind of true. For lunch, we had sandwiches + pasta salad + fruit + a cookie + a drink, but everything was pre-boxed. To be fair, it was very filling and wasn&rsquo;t <em>bad</em>, but I&rsquo;m automatically biased against untoasted sandwiches, especially cold ones. I think given the choice, I&rsquo;d have preferred dimsum too<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>After lunch, I spent a few hours walking around in circles around the garden patio rehearsing my talk (and fidgeting with the light-up spinners I&rsquo;d grabbed from the sponsor showcase). My talk went alright. I covered the content in <a href="https://kewbi.sh/blog/posts/240526/">a previous post</a>, but it was great seeing it resonate with people and I do genuinely feel that they got something from it. There weren&rsquo;t a lot of people, since I was the last talk session and people were either tapped out, heading to external events, or grabbing cocktails upstairs at happy hour. I got good questions, though, and sparked some follow-up discussion points for future research. Talking to a mostly empty room is just as terrifying as a full one! I think I fumbled a lot in the beginning but found my stride halfway through. I forgot to repeat the questions into the mic, I missed some of my points, and I didn&rsquo;t get to share with as many people as I&rsquo;d hoped, but I really enjoyed the experience and found it very fulfilling.</p>
<p>I walked out post-talk feeling energized, relieved, and ready to nab as much swag as possible from the happy hour upstairs. With my heavy backpacks (besides my personal one, the PgM gave me another one with some swag), I triumphantly made my way up the escalators while Dua Lipa was blaring on the speakers. On my ride up, the mix of catchy pop – I think it was Don&rsquo;t Start Now – and much less stress, not to mention the beautiful afternoon sun, made me feel like I was on top of the world. The boost of confidence made me briefly consider trying to sneak a beer from the drink cart (purely for the comedy, I don&rsquo;t drink), but System 2 clicked in and I got a mock margarita instead.</p>
<p>Newly hydrated, I hit the sponsor showcase in search of swag. I&rsquo;d already gotten this custom OSSNA 2024 picnic blanket at checkin, so I&rsquo;d been lugging that as well as both my personal bag and a gifted backpack around the whole day. But after the happy hour, my backpack, both my pockets, and even the bag I was using to carry the gifted backpack were full with random knickknacks. I got a red RedHat hat. I got multiple fidget spinners (some of which lit up and flashed). I got a yoyo for my dad. I got a tote bag. I got a totebag to hold the totebag. I put one of my backpacks into the totebag that was holding the other totebag. I stopped for some appetizers and was eating outside the main hall, when I noticed an abandoned white cardboard cube. Out of curiosity, I snuck a look at it, and it turned out to be a GitHub mug. I returned it to the booth and asked if I could keep it, and learned that they&rsquo;d been giving away as a sweepstakes prize, which unfortunately I didn&rsquo;t win any of. A shame — those Lego flower sets would have been cool. At the end of the day, my arms were killing me. I saw someone with one of those grocery shopping wheelie carts full to the brim with tshirts and merch, and I was kicking myself that I hadn&rsquo;t thought of that. I went to Cheesecake Factory for dinner with my parents (a childhood favourite) and was showing off my swag. They were already impressed with what I&rsquo;d had in my bag before I&rsquo;d even started emptying my pockets, which were full of stickers, small toys, and a stuffed chameleon (thanks SUSE!). I was lucky we were driving back and had plenty of room in the car for the extra backpack — I can&rsquo;t imagine having to fly back with limited luggage.</p>
<p>The next day, I got up bright and early to make the free breakfast, which was better than the lunch but was still lacking toasted bagels. After breakfast, I stuck around for Linus Torvald&rsquo;s keynote talk — I didn&rsquo;t really take away much from it because I was a little busy fangirling. To this day, I still couldn&rsquo;t tell if the conversation was scripted or not, but it was really cool seeing one of the key figures in open source in real life and not just as some revered email handle. I did some French flashcards after the keynote, since my exam was in less than twelve hours, while I was waiting for the showcase to open up again. Didn&rsquo;t you have an exam to get to, you ask? This was very true, but my dad had seen someone with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zephyr_(operating_system)">Zephyr</a> kite the day before and he was dead set on coming home with one. Thus, I was sent into the showcase right when it opened to listen to the spiel in exchange for a kite. When I got back into the car and we set out, my dad asked, very melancholically, why I didn&rsquo;t get two.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, I wasn&rsquo;t able to move my second exam, so right after his keynote, we headed back to Vancouver. We made it with a few hours to spare before my second final, but I hadn&rsquo;t really slept well so wasn&rsquo;t able to cram much. I made myself a shot of matcha, spedran a little more Anki, and prayed that the studying I&rsquo;d put in throughout the rest of the term would come in handy then.</p>
<p>Here are some brief lessons learned:</p>
<ul>
<li>Leave more time for attending other talks, instead of stressing about your own. Plan out the talks you&rsquo;ll attend in advance and look for topics far outside of your comfort zone, since conferences are a good way to find yourself in close proximity to experts in diverse fields.</li>
<li>Your talk will be okay, even if you feel that you underprepared. This might be a uniquely me thing — I&rsquo;ve been realizing I can be more cursory (for my definition of cursory) than I expect and still surprise myself.</li>
<li>Obviously, prepare earlier. Ask for feedback earlier, so you can go through multiple rounds of it and don&rsquo;t feel so overwhelmed by pages of notes in the days leading up to the conference. This also gives you the opportunity to be more comfortable during the first time you rehearse for feedback, so you can focus on content comments instead of criticism about missing your cues or whatnot.</li>
<li>Look for scholarships or reimbursements from the conference, your school, or your/external companies to cover costs. I was able to drive down to Seattle, avoiding flight costs, but the Linux Foundation also has grants available that covered my hotel costs. I was able to also get a scholarship from my university to cover the gas and miscellaneous fees.</li>
<li>Ask professors for help when it&rsquo;s needed. You&rsquo;re not alone, and even if it feels embarrassing to be frantically trying to prep days ahead of the talk, they can offer a more mature, experienced outlook.</li>
<li>Strategize how you&rsquo;ll get swag. Keep your backpack as empty as possible. Try to bring a tote bag and figure out how to binpack your swag based on your weight and swag size limits.</li>
</ul>
<p>Giving a talk is something I&rsquo;d certainly do again! I&rsquo;ve already applied for a few other CFPs with this same talk or other interesting things I&rsquo;d like to speak about. It&rsquo;s given me an opportunity to learn how to present myself and my work and start establishing myself as some sort of respectable resource while also meeting others and exploring a new venue/city.</p>
<p>Thank you again to the Linux Foundation for making this incredible trip and talk possible. Many thanks also to my parents for taking time off to drive me and support me day-of. And of course, thanks to my math prof for letting me move my exam and make it to give the talk that&rsquo;s left me feeling so energized, bold, and excited.</p>

      <description>On GitHub Issues, PRs, and all the links in between.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>In mid-April, I had the opportunity to speak at <a href="https://ossna2024.sched.com/">Open Source Summit North America 2024</a>, held in Seattle. I spoke about research that I&rsquo;ve been working with Professors <a href="https://dwyoon.com/">Dongwook Yoon</a>, <a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~bestchai/">Ivan Beschastnikh</a>, and <a href="https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=5kncGscAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Cleidson de Souza</a> on: characterizing open-source collaboration patterns from the GitHub Issues and PRs that they comprise. I was nervous attending my first real conference, let alone speaking, but it was an amazing first experience. Even though I was only there for a day<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, it was an incredibly fulfilling one, and I&rsquo;m grateful to the organizing committee for making the conference a welcoming, engaging success.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll touch on more of my conference experience and some backstory (because oh boy, is there a backstory) in another post, but I wanted to first share my talk in post format. This article will be a transcript-style rehash of my talk based on my speaker notes, but if you&rsquo;d prefer to watch my talk rather than read, I&rsquo;ve also listed it here. The raw slides are available <a href="https;//emilie.ma/ossna2024">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="talk-intro">Talk Intro</h2>
<figure><img src="/img/240526/1.png"/>
</figure>

<p>Hi friends! I&rsquo;m Emilie, an undergrad at the University of British Columbia and software developer. I&rsquo;ve recently had the privilege of working with Professors Cleidson de Souza, Dongwook Yoon, and Ivan Beschastnikh at UBC on the topic of understanding open-source development practices empirically, in the real world. We found that there&rsquo;s a lot of hidden context and unspoken patterns that GitHub and other development platforms don&rsquo;t highlight, and today, I&rsquo;m going to show you how we revealed them. We analyzed over fifty large open-source projects hosted on GitHub and developed a novel graph-based perspective that we&rsquo;re calling the PR-Issue Graph.</p>
<figure><img src="/img/240526/2.png"/>
</figure>

<p>Today, I&rsquo;ll cover our methodology, this PR-Issue graph&rsquo;s attributes, and our workflow type definitions. You&rsquo;ll walk away with a new outlook on managing open-source collaboration, able to recognize common workflow patterns and what they might mean for your community. I hope this talk will spark some discussion and brainstorming over how we can be mindful of these workflow types as we lead open source development efforts.</p>
<h2 id="about-github">About GitHub</h2>
<figure><img src="/img/240526/3.png"/>
</figure>

<p>How many of you are familiar with GitHub? It&rsquo;s a developer platform built on top of the version control software Git. You&rsquo;ve probably already heard of it in some of the previous talks. GitHub is a popular choice among open source projects as a central platform for collaboration.</p>
<figure><img src="/img/240526/4.png"/>
</figure>

<p>On GitHub, community bug reports, feature requests, or general discussion about projects are done on issues. On the slide are a couple examples of projects we&rsquo;ve studied. I&rsquo;d like to highlight that issues have a designated status. You can see that on the left, the issue is open, which usually means it hasn&rsquo;t been addressed; and on the right, it&rsquo;s closed, meaning someone has fixed the issue or the discussion has been deemed off-topic or closed.</p>
<figure><img src="/img/240526/5.png"/>
</figure>

<p>New code, perhaps addressing these Issues, is merged into projects via Pull Requests, or PRs. They also have statuses: open, if it&rsquo;s undergoing or will undergo review; closed, if the work was unsatisfactory or extraneous; and merged, if it&rsquo;s been accepted and integrated into the project. People discuss and review code in PRs. As well, folks can link to Issues in a PR: for example, if a PR fixes an issue that&rsquo;s already been reported, contributors will typically link to the issue within their PR to create an explicit connection between the two.</p>
<figure><img src="/img/240526/6.png"/>
</figure>

<p>Here, that link has an explicit &lsquo;fixes&rsquo; type. GitHub will automatically create two types of links for you: &lsquo;fixes&rsquo; or &lsquo;duplicate&rsquo;. If you mention a keyword associated with &lsquo;fixes&rsquo; or &lsquo;duplicate&rsquo; with an issue number, GitHub will create a link with the appropriate type. Here, the link was created with the keyword &lsquo;closes&rsquo;, which is associated with the &lsquo;fixes type&rsquo;.</p>
<figure><img src="/img/240526/7.png"/>
</figure>

<p>If we frame this as a collaboration graph for a second, we start to see something basic but interesting emerge. Let&rsquo;s consider the PRs and issues as nodes, and the links between them as edges. We can model the different node types and statuses: so here, purple means merged, green means open, and red means closed, just like in the GitHub UI. This is a graph-based visualization of the example I&rsquo;ve been showing: we have a problem (Issue 8150, the red square), and we have a solution (PR 8156, the purple circle), the PR fixes the Issue, and there&rsquo;s nothing else connected to this work.</p>
<figure><img src="/img/240526/8.png"/>
</figure>

<p>Here&rsquo;s another example of this graph based perspective, this time with an explicit &lsquo;duplicate&rsquo; link taken from a project called discord.py. Here&rsquo;s a visualization of what that looks like. The problem reported in this issue on the left was marked as a duplicate of this other issue on the right. The issue on the right was created earlier and covers the same problem of a missing field.</p>
<figure><img src="/img/240526/9.png"/>
</figure>

<p>Prior work in software engineering research has focused on these links extensively. While the examples I&rsquo;ve shown have explicit link types that are detectable and supported by GitHub, about 85% of links on GitHub don&rsquo;t have a &lsquo;fixes&rsquo; or &lsquo;duplicate&rsquo; relationship, according to <a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~bestchai/papers/cscw21-pr-references.pdf">Chopra et al</a>. Researchers have been primarily trying to classify these blank links into richer categories than just &lsquo;fixes&rsquo; or &lsquo;duplicates&rsquo;, and many papers have built several distinct taxonomies for doing so, including link types like &lsquo;dependent&rsquo;, or &rsquo;enhanced&rsquo;. Some work has also been done to do this automatically, with NLP classifiers.</p>
<figure><img src="/img/240526/10.png"/>
</figure>

<p>However, let&rsquo;s take this idea one step further. We were interested in &lsquo;zooming out&rsquo; of the prior, very focused research on individual links. Our research is the first to look at multi-node clusters of issues and PRs as a graph. This graph perspective grants us more context, as we simply have more metadata and relationships to examine, which in turn gives us a richer understanding of the work practices associated with each type of graph. For example, with more context, we can understand larger implications about the development work practices in a project, like if developers break their work down into small chunks for review, or if there&rsquo;s a lot of competition in certain areas of the project. This graph perspective is what we&rsquo;ve nicknamed GitHub&rsquo;s PR-Issue Graph, and for the rest of this talk, I&rsquo;ll show you what lurking insights about open-source collaboration we&rsquo;ve found hidden in it.</p>
<h2 id="methodology">Methodology</h2>
<figure><img src="/img/240526/11.png"/>
</figure>

<p>You might be wondering how we did all this analysis. We chose to analyze GitHub as our platform of choice because of its popularity, its data availability, and the diversity of projects hosted on it. We initially scraped 56 popular projects on GitHub, based on a prior sample by <a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~bestchai/papers/cscw21-pr-references.pdf">Chopra et al</a>. These cover a variety of topics, like machine learning with projects like mlflow and foundational technologies like gRPC. We downloaded the contents, metadata, and links of more than ninety thousand nodes. We used a diversity sampling technique to generate a sample of sixty clusters, or subgraphs, in which each link was manually coded into a list of extended link types. From there, we identified some repeated structural patterns that we thought could represent work practices in software development.</p>
<figure><img src="/img/240526/12.png"/>
</figure>

<p>Next, we imported the issues and PRs and their metadata into <a href="https://neo4j.com/">Neo4j</a>, a graph database software, and created reusable queries to search for all occurrences of these collaboration patterns. Onscreen, you can see an image of the built-in query browser visualizing some results.</p>
<figure><img src="/img/240526/13.png"/>
</figure>

<p>We also developed an image visualization module and interactive explorer tool that we used to streamline manual coding and validate our findings during interviews with open source developers. Here&rsquo;s what this looked like.</p>
<h2 id="project-characterization">Project Characterization</h2>
<figure><img src="/img/240526/14.png"/>
</figure>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start with some characterization of the projects we studied. We found all the connected components, or clusters of connected issues or PRs, and measured their sizes and frequencies, which is shown in this bar chart. The x-axis here shows component size, and the y-axis show the number of clusters of that size on a log scale.</p>
<p>Cluster sizes are important, as they give us an immediate intuitive idea of how collaboration is normally structured: we can understand if people tend to build on previous work, making larger clusters of connected nodes, or if they create one-off PRs or Issues.</p>
<p>We found that cluster sizes followed a power law distribution, with many isolated nodes not connected to anything else and a few very large components with lots of nodes and interlinking. We found that there are ten times as many isolated nodes than 2-node components, which is unusual. You might think with how GitHub is structured around collaboration and documentation, there&rsquo;d be a lot of PR to Issue links, or problem-solution pairs. Instead, we observed a lot of distinct problems or solutions that don&rsquo;t apply to or aren&rsquo;t linked to each other.</p>
<p>This power law distribution can help maintainers predict growth and appropriately allocate resources: power law distributions often indicate the presence of a few highly connected and influential hubs of nodes, so when we observe larger clusters starting to form, we can know, oh, okay, it&rsquo;s likely that work and collaboration will continue to grow.</p>
<figure><img src="/img/240526/15.png"/>
</figure>

<p>We also hypothesized that connected components of different sizes represented different types of work. We found that small clusters of nodes had more issues (shown in blue), which represents that they have more problems, fewer closed issues or merged PRs, so the work is left more unfinished, and a shorter duration between first and last update, indicating small clusters of nodes tend to represent isolated problems.</p>
<p>On the other hand, large connected components had fewer issues with more merged PRs and a longer duration. We might think of large connected components as more mature and active initiatives in a project, whereas isolated PRs or issues might represent one-off contributions.</p>
<p>Again, this can help with prioritization: larger clusters represent these critical areas where lots of high-impact collaboration is happening, so it&rsquo;s worth taking a look to see how those issues are being managed. This is also useful for encouraging diverse contributions: developers new to open-source might just want to tackle a one-off issue, so smaller clusters or isolated issues might be a good place to start. On the other hand, developers looking to tackle a challenging core problem might want to start looking at the open issues in one of these large clusters or use them as reference documentation for past design decisions.</p>
<h2 id="workflow-type-definitions">Workflow Type Definitions</h2>
<figure><img src="/img/240526/16.png"/>
</figure>

<p>Next, I&rsquo;ll cover the cornerstone of our work: our workflow type definitions. Let&rsquo;s start by taking a look at one of these clusters of issues and PRs. Here&rsquo;s an example from the <a href="https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py/">discord.py</a> project, a library used to build chatbots and other automations for the app Discord. Here, someone is requesting a feature — something to do with adding <code>invoke_parent</code>. Then, two folks have come along to create their own implementations of this feature. sudosnok on the left proposed an approach, but it was vetoed by the maintainer of the project. A few days later, SebbyLaw submits their own implementation, which is eventually merged. Note that both PRs reference the original issue with those &ldquo;fixes&rdquo; keywords I mentioned before: sudosnok used &ldquo;closes&rdquo;, and SebbyLaw uses &ldquo;resolves&rdquo;. Let&rsquo;s visualize this as a graph. This is actually an example of one of our workflow types: the competing PRs workflow type. The competing PRs workflow type abstracts this example a bit by allowing for more competition, and more of these closed PRs.</p>
<figure><img src="/img/240526/17.png"/>
</figure>

<p>These workflow types are associated with work practices, like &lsquo;breaking down complex work into small chunks&rsquo;. Each workflow type also has a prototypical graph structure, as shown here. These graph structures were combinations of four types of metadata constraints: node type, status, authorship, and creation timestamps. We&rsquo;ve defined nine prototypical examples of workflow types: I&rsquo;ll go through a couple today.</p>
<figure><img src="/img/240526/18.png"/>
</figure>

<figure><img src="/img/240526/19.png"/>
</figure>

<p>Sometimes, contributors are eager to offer their own implementation of a task, and begin working on one while not communicating, which we observed in our competing PRs workflow type. The discord.py example I just showed earlier was one of these. It has a graph structure of a closed issue, this red square, connected to multiple PRs, with only one PR being merged, this purple circle. These PRs are created by different people, represented by the little people icons labelled A and B.</p>
<p>As in the discord example, you might have a feature request that multiple contributors start working on in parallel without &lsquo;claiming&rsquo; the issue or otherwise communicating, and now you have multiple candidate implementations to review. Its associated work practice, or in this case, malpractice, has an implication that there was some wasted work due to poor communication, although competing PRs also allowed projects to be picky about what they merged. That discord.py example showed how the maintainer called out a performance implication in the first PR that they didn&rsquo;t like.</p>
<figure><img src="/img/240526/20.png"/>
</figure>

<p>Another painfully familiar issue in open source is duplicate issues, where contributors report similar problems that are duplicates of previous discussions. Redirecting them to other, established discussions, takes valuable maintainer time. This is captured in our duplicate issue hub workflow type. Its structure consists of a issue, this leftmost red square, connected via &lsquo;duplicate&rsquo; links to many other issues, the red squares on the right. The <code>t=0</code> notation means that this hub issue, Issue 1, was created before the other duplicate issues on the right.</p>
<p>This happens if a bug goes out in a release, for example, many folks might report it at the same time without first searching through the other issues posted to GitHub, causing additional maintenance burden. Though this was one of the workflow types we first thought of and observed in our query refinement process, it turns out that duplicate hubs are actually rather infrequent. We observed only 15 instances of them, over all 90K nodes.</p>
<p>However, I&rsquo;ll note that when issues are highly noticeable, as with breaking changes, these duplicate issue hubs can grow quite large. Here&rsquo;s another example from the discord.py project: issue 5867 caused by a breaking change on the underlying app&rsquo;s end was connected to 11 duplicate issues. When maintainers notice high-growth or large duplicate issue hubs, it&rsquo;s worth considering how the change can be better communicated and made noticeable for users.</p>
<figure><img src="/img/240526/21.png"/>
</figure>

<p>To perhaps combat some of the miscommunication that cause duplicate issue hubs, projects also tend to publish updates about recent work. Here&rsquo;s an example from the <a href="https://github.com/apache/dubbo/">apache/dubbo</a> project, which employs a bot to create weekly Issues as a status report. It lists all the merged PRs from the last week. We observed this in our Integrating PR/Issue hub workflow type: its structure is a central PR or issue, as shown on the left, linked to many merged PRs, so those purple circles you see on the right.</p>
<p>The dubbo project used issues to collect reports, but some projects also use a PR: for example, listing all the PRs merged into the latest release candidate before merging that release candidate PR into the mainline branch.</p>
<p>This workflow type has a temporal constraint: the central PR tends to be created <em>after</em> the merged PRs. In practice, this typically models a release or documentation workflow, where maintainers aim to surface work after the fact so the community is more aware of what initiatives are occurring.</p>
<figure><img src="/img/240526/22.png"/>
</figure>

<p><a href="https://kewbi.sh/blog/posts/230611/">Stacked PRs</a> and <a href="https://graphite.dev/">Graphite.dev</a> are becoming more popular recently: if you&rsquo;re not familiar with Stacked PRs, they&rsquo;re a workflow for creating small, incremental PRs that build on each other and that facilitate code review and dev velocity. For example, I might make a small PR to update the backend, then a small PR to update the frontend, then a small PR to update the docs.</p>
<p>Our Dependent PRs workflow type models this type of workflow. Its graph structure is a series of PRs referencing one another in a chain, with a limited set of authors, usually just one. This workflow type is regarded as a good practice as it makes changes easier to understand and ship without blocking implementation work on a review.</p>
<figure><img src="/img/240526/23.png"/>
</figure>

<p>Finally, we found that developers tend to sometimes overdeliver in their PRs, addressing multiple issues at once. Here&rsquo;s an example of a PR taken from the <a href="https://github.com/grpc/grpc-web">grpc-web</a> project. A single PR fixes many issues that are, at first glance, unrelated. PRs like these will be more difficult to review and give feedback for, since the fixes are all mixed up in each other. This workflow is captured in our Divergent PR workflow type. It has the structure of a merged PR, this purple circle, that fixes several linked issues at once, these red squares.</p>
<p>This can be both positive, as when the linked issues are related or have the same underlying fix, or negative, as in the grpc-web example when the issues are unrelated. Again, negative divergent PRs violate the general principle of small, easily-understood PRs addressing a single issue.</p>
<h2 id="workflow-type-comparison">Workflow Type Comparison</h2>
<figure><img src="/img/240526/24.png"/>
</figure>

<p>Let&rsquo;s now talk about some ways these patterns compared to one another. We wanted to understand how frequently each workflow type arose in projects as it would explain the most common ways engineers work. We ran each of our queries across all 90K nodes, and counted up the number of matches from each workflow type. We found over a thousand matches of our workflow type definitions.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more was that we found that these patterns weren&rsquo;t evenly represented across projects: some workflow types were more frequently used, and we hypothesize that they&rsquo;re more natural or embedded in software development culture. For example, the Consequent Issue-PR workflow type we identified was very popular : that&rsquo;s an issue solved by a PR, which creates another issue. It represents the typical pull-based development model of Issue-PR well, so it wasn&rsquo;t surprising that that was the most frequent workflow type. Another example: we didn&rsquo;t see a lot of competing PRs, which implies that there&rsquo;s usually limited wasted work.</p>
<p>This might be useful to keep in the back of your head as a benchmark: if your project has many more duplicate issue hubs or competing PRs than what we observed, that might be a sign to re-evaluate your issue reporting or code review workflows.</p>
<figure><img src="/img/240526/25.png"/>
</figure>

<p>Finally, we observed that workflow types are fairly representative of the projects. 52% of all nodes that could have been in a workflow type – so, in a cluster with some other nodes and some links, were in a workflow type. Most projects contained at least one match, with larger projects tending to have more matches. This is a graph of the number of nodes in projects to the number of workflow types we observed in said project, with each dot representing a project, and you can see this general upwards correlation. You can see the largest projects, like <a href="https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly">App-vNext/Polly</a> and <a href="https://github.com/apache/dubbo/">Apache Dubbo</a>, had the most workflow type matches, with about 150 matches each.</p>
<p>To us, this indicated that there&rsquo;s some connection between project maturity leading to more organized collaboration and higher usage of these structured workflow types. This was consistent with the fact that the projects that used no workflow types, like <a href="https://github.com/roboguice/roboguice">roboguice</a> or <a href="https://github.com/go-chi/chi">go-chi</a>, were all relatively small, with only a couple hundred contributions. If your project has a very high number of workflow types, this represents that your project tends to have highly structured collaboration, which can be good.</p>
<figure><img src="/img/240526/26.png"/>
</figure>

<p>These were our takeaways from examining workflow type matches. But we were also curious what open source developers — you all — thought. We validated our definition and visualization tools with open-source developers in a series of six interviews. They focused on introducing developers to the interactive explorer tool preloaded with their project.</p>
<figure><img src="/img/240526/27.png"/>
</figure>

<p>All developers agreed workflow types would help make better decisions on aspects of the development process. Some examples taken from our interviews: someone noted duplicate issue hubs might indicate a need for change in the documentation or bug reporting process, another person came up with the unique idea that workflow types can help prioritize and direct maintainership. If you see a competing PRs cluster, for example, but you see one of the PRs is part of a divergent PR cluster that resolves multiple issues, you might want to review that solution first. Our interviewees all noted that the visualization tools were useful for understanding inter-dependencies between features, providing valuable context that GitHub doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Finally, some interviewees rightfully highlighted that workflow types are limited because they don&rsquo;t examine the content of the issue, but we hope the visualization tool making even the initial surfacing of collaboration patterns easier is a first step.</p>
<h2 id="implications">Implications</h2>
<figure><img src="/img/240526/28.png"/>
</figure>

<p>Our work has wide-ranging implications. First, we&rsquo;ve seen how examining the sizes of clusters of linked issues and PRs can demonstrate the type of work it contains. Because clusters tend to be either very small or grow to be very large, this can predict growth in certain areas of the project and in turn inform resource allocation and prioritization.</p>
<p>As well, we&rsquo;ve seen that the visualizations of the graph perspectives can help navigate between initiatives and surface issues or PRs where additional effort is high impact, something our interviewed developers noted. The WorkflowsExplorer tool can be used to figure out which PR among a competing PRs workflow type is best to review, as I brought up before, and to visualize dependencies between features in development.</p>
<p>The tool can also help visually find problem areas in a project, where there are outsize numbers of competing PRs, duplicate issue hubs, or other forms of wasted work.</p>
<p><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3338906.3338949">Hirao et al.</a> argued that code review and duplicate issue identification tools can be improved by closer inspection of the links between nodes, among several other factors. Our approach does just that, and even extends it by analyzing multiple links within a cluster of nodes. Another implication of our graph perspective is that it&rsquo;ll allow us to further improve these tools: we can use our insights on cluster sizes to improve good-first-issue detection.</p>
<p>But the biggest next step for our work is talking more with developers like you. I&rsquo;ve already spoken about some of the developer interviews we&rsquo;ve conducted, but if you&rsquo;d like to work with us on understanding the collaboration patterns in your project, please get in touch or find me after this talk!</p>
<h2 id="talk-conclusion">Talk Conclusion</h2>
<figure><img src="/img/240526/29.png"/>
</figure>

<p>Today, I&rsquo;ve covered our novel graph-based perspective and our ideas for the workflow types definitions. The core plus of our approach is that it can be easily automated, making it easier for maintainers to identify and curb unwanted types of collaboration. As well, I&rsquo;ve highlighted some insights that this graph perspective has revealed and how we can make use of them to steer your communities in a better direction. Think of this PR-Issue graph as a Grafana dashboard that lets you monitor your project&rsquo;s collaboration health: it acts as a global point of reference for understanding your project as a whole and can give you early alerts when things might be going south. Again, reach out if you&rsquo;d like to work together with us!</p>

      <description>On mischief and a hacker&#39;s mindset.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p><a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2022/03/08/tiny-programs/">Julia Evans</a> wrote a blog a while ago about writing tiny personal programs — the kind of thing where a website or service has some friction in behaving as you want it to, and you bust out some Python or Bash to wrestle it into compliance. Because the original site wasn&rsquo;t working as intended, these scripts tend to use features not intended for general consumption, since if the features were integrated into the main software you&rsquo;d probably not be writing the script in the first place. Some examples include manually inspecting web requests to hit the same internal API endpoint, or scraping HTML and parsing it with BeautifulSoup. As well, these scripts are usually written for a single user or maybe a small group of users, so it&rsquo;s reasonable to slap it together as fast as possible without much regard for its scalability or maintainability. If you only have a couple users, it&rsquo;s easier just to give them a detailed list of instructions and constraints (&lsquo;don&rsquo;t press the big red button until you&rsquo;ve typed into this text field!&rsquo;) than worry about handling edge conditions gracefully. When you see someone write a script like this, what words come to mind?</p>
<p>Two that spring to mind for me are <code>hacky</code> and <code>janky</code>: they&rsquo;re hacky, because they work around the limitations of what&rsquo;s presented, usually in an unintended way; and they&rsquo;re janky, because they&rsquo;re delicately cobbled together and fragile. I also find that <code>hacky</code> and <code>janky</code> both tend to be synonyms of <code>mischief</code>, and this sort of well-intentioned mischief and app misuse is what I&rsquo;d like to touch on today.</p>
<p>This janky mischief has a spectrum of seriousness. On one hand, you have Evans&rsquo; scripts, which mostly serve some real-world problems, like finding vaccine appointments. On the other, you have satirical (sorry, I meant very deeply serious) conferences like <a href="https://sigbovik.org/">SIGBOVIK</a> and <a href="https://programmingwithstyle.com/posts/howihackedmycar/">humorous stories on HN</a> that just hack for the sake of it. The stories I&rsquo;ll share in this post lie somewhere in between — my workarounds all do serve a genuine purpose, but I also find the way I went about implementing them very comedic<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>This is a post about my recent hacky hanky-panky and a hacker&rsquo;s mindset. You shouldn&rsquo;t do any of the following, in order to save time and have more confidence in your workflows, but maybe they&rsquo;ll inspire you to pull some hacky mischief yourself.</p>
<h2 id="copy-as-png">Copy as PNG</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve recently been building <a href="https://nested.name">NestedName</a>, a site to find <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_hack">domain hacks</a> with your name. For example, it&rsquo;d help me find the domains <code>emil.ie</code> and <code>emilie.ma</code>, the latter of which I do own. I&rsquo;ve been planning for a soft launch and some outreach, so I&rsquo;ve been working on an animation for Twitter describing NestedName and its features as a little intro reel.</p>
<p>The sane thing to do would be to use a video recorder app, as my friend quickly pointed out. There are several tools that record your screen, then zoom in on your cursor and where you&rsquo;re typing to generate smooth, polished demo videos. But I didn&rsquo;t know of these beforehand, and anyways I wanted some specific animations in my video, so I thought I&rsquo;d just hand-animate it.</p>
<p>All my design for NestedName happens in Figma, so I thought I&rsquo;d look into plugins for animation within Figma so I could easily reuse design assets. I&rsquo;d already <a href="https://kewbi.sh/blog/posts/231231/">abused Figma for presentations before</a>, so I knew animations wasn&rsquo;t too far of a stretch. I was able to find a couple, including <a href="https://jitter.video/">Jitter.video</a>, <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/733025261168520714/figmotion">Figmotion</a>, and <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/889777319208467032/motion-ui-and-games-animation">Motion</a>. Jitter&rsquo;s free offering had a watermark, Figmotion was nice but wasn&rsquo;t able to animate between several frames, and Motion, while being the most intuitive, had a free tier with a 2s export limit, far too low for my ~20s goal. These tools also all relied on manually creating keyframes and adjusting animation durations, which was tedious and frustrating.</p>
<p><a href="https://canva.com">Canva</a> is another design tool I&rsquo;ve used. It boasts an impressive selection of community-created templates, useful for when I need an impressive-looking poster for a class without wanting to start from scratch. They also have a video editing tool and basic animations available: think &lsquo;pan&rsquo;, &lsquo;appear&rsquo;, and &lsquo;rise&rsquo;. After fighting various Figma plugins for an afternoon, I decided to just roll with whatever Canva had available and try animating with Figma instead.</p>
<p>Canva&rsquo;s free design tools are less powerful than Figma&rsquo;s though, since they&rsquo;re aimed at different markets. For one, Canva doesn&rsquo;t allow you to import custom fonts if you&rsquo;re not on their paid tier, and its font library, while extensive, also lacks the Google fonts that I&rsquo;m using with NestedName. A good idea at this point would perhaps to go back to find an appropriate screen recorder so I&rsquo;d be able to just record the NestedName interface and use Canva to edit on top of it. However, I decided a reasonable, rational, and clearly-thought-out alternative was to go into Figma, copy each text block as a PNG, and paste it into Canva as an image. I&rsquo;d then animate the individual textblocks as if they were text elements, and stitch the final animation together with Canva. This required a lot of exporting and copy-pasting: if you&rsquo;re ever in my boat, a good Figma shortcut to know is <code>Ctrl-Shift-C</code> for &lsquo;copy as PNG&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Canva&rsquo;s animation interface is more intuitive than manual keyframes, as it&rsquo;s mostly drag-and-drop and click-to-select for animations. This also means it&rsquo;s less powerful unless you&rsquo;re on the paid version, but even then the additional features are very limited.</p>
<ul>
<li>For one, you can&rsquo;t delay animations, so they all play in sequence at the start of the page. I wanted to delay some animations, though, so I&rsquo;d duplicate the page in Canva, set the first page&rsquo;s duration to be longer, and only apply the animation to the second page.</li>
<li>If I wanted to delay an animation after a page transition like a crossfade or wipe, I&rsquo;d create an empty interstitial page, set it to have a short duration of 0.3s, then have my main animated page.</li>
<li>Canva&rsquo;s animations on each page play in sequence following a heuristic from top down, from left to right. I had to rearrange some of my pages so the animation order would be correct, or otherwise use my workaround of creating several pages to animate one &lsquo;visual&rsquo; page.</li>
<li>You can&rsquo;t change the direction of certain animations on the free tier, so if you want to have an element fly in, it can only fly in from the left. Take this into consideration when laying out slides.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the whole, the animation experience was quite straightforward, and I found the point-and-click interface to be a better workflow than manually creating keyframes. Even if it required a lot of hacky text rasterization and animation tool misuse, you can&rsquo;t really tell in the final video. You can see the finished product <a href="https://twitter.com/nestedname">here</a> — while you&rsquo;re there, feel free to follow and stay tuned for more updates!</p>
<h2 id="githubdb">GitHubDB</h2>
<p>I wrote a <a href="https://github.com/kewbish/matter">static RSS feed aggregator</a> a few years ago, and as part of that project I wanted to add bookmarks. However, I wanted to avoid setting up another server as much as possible, because I was already using up all my then-free Heroku credits on running the CORS proxy for the site. Of course, I realized that I could just add a few endpoints to the CORS proxy app to handle bookmarks as well, but I also wanted to avoid setting up my own authentication as much as possible, which would have required setting up MongoDB or another free database provider<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. Too much effort, I reckoned.</p>
<p>Clearly, though, outsourcing authentication to a GitHub OAuth app was much easier. Then, I could just store my bookmarks as comments on a GitHub issue in the same private repo I already use to store my notes, so my bookmarks would be accessible from GitHub as well! <a href="https://twitter.com/fortysevenfx/status/1343587407799738368">There&rsquo;s even prior art</a> for the idea, though I came up with it separately.</p>
<p>Using GitHub issue comments to store and read bookmarks from is perhaps my most egregious misuse of GitHub, but I&rsquo;ve also used it for sharing unlisted files and portfolios. Last year, I was applying to research assistant positions at my university and needed to submit a portfolio of prior work. I could have set up a separate unlinked portfolio page, but I also wanted to host several large demo videos, and while I could do that with Netlify, I wanted to send the portfolio ASAP rather than fiddling with styling another page. So, I threw everything into a private, unlisted Gist and sent the link to my professor. Little known fact: Gists can be cloned and committed to just like normal Git repos, so while the Gist interface doesn&rsquo;t let you upload binary files directly, you can just push them from the command line.</p>
<p>Recently, I&rsquo;ve also been considering using GitHub Mobile as a mobile text editor app for my blog posts. I make this arbitrary delineation between my time at home: &lsquo;upstairs&rsquo; being work in my office, and &lsquo;downstairs&rsquo; being time in the living room, maybe with a tablet. I&rsquo;d like to better utilize some of my &lsquo;downstairs&rsquo; doomscrolling time, so I&rsquo;ve downloaded GitHub mobile and plan to use it to read through and edit some of my drafts, which are themselves committed into my private notes repo.</p>
<p>I have this concept of &lsquo;free-driven development&rsquo;: making software architecture or process decisions motivated purely on keeping everything within the free tier of service providers. Using GitHub as a free, private database was one such decision. I think this concept also gels well with the hacker&rsquo;s mindset of finding workarounds to artificial pricing limits.</p>
<h2 id="smtp-please">SMTP, Please</h2>
<p>When I first bought the <code>kewbi.sh</code> domain, I wanted to set up email so I could send and receive emails from a nice <code>hey@kewbi.sh</code> address. Receiving email to this address was easy enough with mail forwarding from Namecheap, but sending mail was a little more complicated. I didn&rsquo;t want to sign up for Google Workspace, which is paid, and I also didn&rsquo;t want to switch to another email provider, which would also likely be paid.</p>
<p>However, there&rsquo;s a relatively well-known workaround to send mail from another domain via the Gmail SMTP servers. It involves generating an app password for the Gmail account you want to use to send emails from, then selecting the Gmail SMTP servers in the configuration and and using that app password as authentication. You can read more about it <a href="https://emailforwardmx.com/knowledgebase/14/Send-mail-with-your-domain-using-Gmail.html">here</a>. I&rsquo;m convinced this probably isn&rsquo;t against ToS, but I&rsquo;m also very aware it&rsquo;s not supported and is likely unintended. Like with most of the other workarounds above, I&rsquo;m relying on undocumented behaviour, which I realize could change any time, taking my whole workflow with it. But if that happens, I&rsquo;ll just hack together another solution — no biggie.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Part of being a hacker is this ability and willingness to bend (software) boundaries and go beyond what you&rsquo;re given at face value. A friend once said they had a thesis that the world is malleable, and I think that&rsquo;s even more so for self-described hackers. We have the skills, or determination to pick up the skills, to navigate beyond what&rsquo;s expressly presented: to misuse Canva, GitHub, Gmail, and more. Even if it&rsquo;s janky, I think that hacky workarounds have their own charm.</p>
<p>An example of free-driven development in the real world: I recently soft-launched <a href="https://nested.name">NestedName</a>, a site to help you find unique domains with domain hacks and unusual TLDs. I think this blog&rsquo;s domain (<code>kewbi.sh</code>) is pretty clean, and I own my full name as a domain (<code>emilie.ma</code>) as well. Quirky domains are something that I nerd out about often, so I wanted to make a site to help folks find them too — check it out, if you haven&rsquo;t already.</p>
<p>I run NestedName for completely free, and there&rsquo;s a fair bit of hackiness behind the scenes. For one, the frontend, dynamic open graph image generation function, DB, and backend are each hosted on separate providers (Cloudflare Pages, Vercel, Supabase, and Fly.io, respectively). For another, I was using an awkward heuristic from the free Cloudflare DNS API to determine if a domain was taken, which proved to be insufficient, as I kept receiving messages about during launch. None of the code follows good design patterns, and when adding new features I try to bodge them in with as little refactoring as possible. It&rsquo;s a fairly small codebase, so it&rsquo;s been feasible so far, and it&rsquo;s been nice not to have to think too hard and just keep shipping.</p>
<p>I find myself dealing with perfectionism and a desire to &lsquo;do things right&rsquo; sometimes. A little mischief around what&rsquo;s possible to make happen tends to take the edge off some of that navel-gazing. I think the hacker mindset embodies this almost rebellious attitude towards the prescriptivism and limits of software: it brings some of the fun back to building. It&rsquo;s just plain fun to dive deep into odd backward compatibility details or be proud of yourself for figuring out a complicated, multi-step, workaround not knowing that another tool exists. As corporate, walled-garden software has grown entrenched in every aspect of our lives, I think we need a little more hanky-panky and creativity in how we (mis)use it, and I hope this collection of mischievous ideas has inspired you to try breaking some limits and exploiting little-known features yourself<sup id="fnref1:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>

      <title>The QoS of QS</title>
      <link>https://kewbi.sh/blog/posts/240225/</link>
      <pubDate>25 Feb 2024</pubDate>

      <description>On self-tracking UX and how we can improve it.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>I came across <a href="https://ericchiang.github.io/post/spotify/">this post by Eric Chiang</a> recently. They downloaded their past ten years of Spotify listening data into a big ZIP and conducted their own version of Spotify Wrapped. They graphed their most listened-to artists, how those artists changed over time, their listening time distribution across the day, and their favourite albums from a particular year. It looks like a fun time capsule and nostalgia trip — the perfect application of some hacky scripting skills.</p>
<p>The post ends off with a call to explore your own data a little more, which got me thinking about the work Chiang did to retrieve all their data, write scripts to process it, and visualize it. All these steps are manual processes: if you want to do something like this, you&rsquo;d better have some time on your hands and a hankering to wrangle with Matplotlib.</p>
<p>You should also have some idea of what exactly you want to find or visualize — otherwise, wading through the hundreds of thousands of raw data points without a goal in sight gets overwhelming. Clearly, as seen on the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39350541">HN discussion</a>, folks do have a lot of ideas for what they&rsquo;d like to visualize (e.g. finding one-hit wonders or songs that are correlated with some other data dimension like the weather). What&rsquo;s the barrier, then? Why aren&rsquo;t we seeing everyone&rsquo;s unique graphs?</p>
<p>Right now, extracting your data from cloud services like Spotify, YouTube, GoodReads, or others requires a lot of <em>effort</em>. Services like Spotify that provide a one-click download button are already making it easier, compared to having to roll your own scraper, but there&rsquo;s still activation energy in seeking out your data and taking the time to visualize it. Because the bottleneck is in the data, I think people tend to end up collecting the data for a particular visualization in mind, rather than the other way around.</p>
<p>But I think that&rsquo;s backwards — to me, it makes more sense to explore your data with visualizations to aid you, unless you have a particular research question in place. For folks who&rsquo;re just trying to get a sense of their data without a specific goal,</p>
<p>This is a post about navigating your data, the Quantified Self community, and how we can make data spelunking more compelling.</p>
<h2 id="quantified-self">Quantified Self</h2>
<p><a href="https://quantifiedself.com/">Quantified Self</a> is a movement broadly centered around <em>tracking</em>. Large swathes of the community are focused on health tracking: one&rsquo;s weight, bodyfat percentage, number of calories burned per day. However, other types of tracking are common: usage of time, mood, carbon footprint due to flights taken, and so on.</p>
<p>People interested in self-experimenting (or inspired by the pretty result graphs) tend to be drawn to QS: it presents some order in our lived experiences, and gives us levers to continue improving our lives. I recently wrote about <a href="https://kewbi.sh/blog/posts/240218/">checkpoints</a>, and I think QS data collection is the extreme manifestation of checkpoints. Collecting tens or hundreds of data points on ourselves a day gives us something to look back on and helps visualize the deltas between timesteps.</p>
<p>QS took off with the adoption of IoT devices and trackers, like the popular FitBit or Apple Watch. These made health data salient and readily available, for the first time. With the advent of SaaS companies and their general trend towards walled gardens, though, our data is becoming more inaccessible and opaque.</p>
<h2 id="quality-of-service">Quality of Service</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;d say the user experience of quantified self tracking is generally very poor. Take the Spotify example: Chiang had to submit a request on a form probably created solely for compliance, then wait up to thirty days for their data to be processed and returned to them. Then, they had to comb through the data to identify points of interest and write a whole bunch of visualization scripts.</p>
<p>This was for a relatively open data faucet, and a single app at that, though. There are folks who&rsquo;ve written whole tool libraries to process and collate every aspect of their lives. <a href="https://beepb00p.xyz/hpi.html">Karlicoss&rsquo;s HPI</a> package brings together their browser history, texts, health data, TODOs, and more into a nice Python interface. I particularly like their motivation for the project:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[O]nce the data is available as Python objects, I can easily plug it into existing tools, libraries and frameworks. It makes building new tools considerably easier and opens up new ways of interacting with the data.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They emphasize the ad-hoc-ness and interactivity that I think the QS experience should be like. Our data are artifacts that we created, and I think we should be able to seamlessly pick and choose from what we&rsquo;ve made to augment and inform what we&rsquo;ll continue to do.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I understand that making straightforward ways to access raw user data probably isn&rsquo;t the best use of engineering resources for a business, who&rsquo;d rather be building their core product instead. There are few who are motivated enough to want their data, so to a business a rarely-used &lsquo;Export my data&rsquo; form suffices.</p>
<p>If most apps won&rsquo;t support the extensive data tracking and collation QS relies on, then, what will? The answer, in practice, is a spreadsheet. Julian Lehr <a href="https://julian.digital/2020/02/23/my-quantified-self-setup/">wrote about their Airtable-based setup</a>, and Felix Krause <a href="https://krausefx.com//blog/how-i-put-my-whole-life-into-a-single-database">wrote about their Telegram bot → SQL database workflow</a>. Both have automated aspects of their data collection based on publically available APIs, but both also have some sort of manual update habit.</p>
<p>In some sense, bringing all your life&rsquo;s data into spreadsheets is the opposite extreme of keeping it all locked away in some SaaS: it&rsquo;s now extremely easy to process and pull into other visualizations or projects, like Karlicoss&rsquo;s work. The user experience is intuitive, though decidedly less captivating than most aesthetic tracker-specific apps.</p>
<p>In my ideal world, we wouldn&rsquo;t have to be explicitly collecting all of our own data: it&rsquo;d export itself, and we&rsquo;d be able to access it anytime from some central, private store. There&rsquo;d be visualizations automatically generated from data<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, reminders and ideas for trends that were detected, and more straightforward data connections between apps. But, for now, spreadsheets are a start.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>To me, current QS tools feel clunky, clinical, and both overwhelming and underpowered. However, I think reframing QS as an inquisitive and explorative activity can help us design better interfaces and processes for it. As well, viewing it through a lens of nostalgia and rediscovery makes for some interesting ideas. I once built <a href="https://github.com/kewbish/phasis">a tool</a> to scan through your notes in a Git repository and resurface notes that you hadn&rsquo;t edited in a while or reflected on, like spaced repetition for your thoughts. While the data I was working off of was less granular than daily health updates and relied on the heuristics available in Git history, this data was also collected <em>ambiently</em>, unlike today&rsquo;s QS tooling.</p>
<p>QS ties into many of my thoughts on <a href="https://kewbi.sh/blog/posts/211114/">metadata</a> and <a href="https://kewbi.sh/blog/posts/210124/">personalizable software</a>, and it&rsquo;s no surprise to me that the ideas that immediately come to mind revolve around richer interactive data formats and <a href="https://kewbi.sh/blog/posts/231126/">translating between data sources</a>. As I mentioned in the introduction, self-tracking also speaks to me as a form of reflection on how I&rsquo;ve changed, but in a quantitative format that&rsquo;s harder to handwave. While I won&rsquo;t be creating a <a href="https://howisfelix.today/">full public life dashboard</a> anytime soon, I&rsquo;m inspired by that level of self-understanding and dedication to making some sense of the strange way of being we call life.</p>
<p>I used to create QS-level stats on my writing output on this blog, and in a now-unpublished post, even stats on the reading I&rsquo;d done over a year. I don&rsquo;t compute any metrics on my writing anymore, since I think it&rsquo;d be fairly disappointing to see my few-and-far-between posts. I&rsquo;d like to change that though: I think lately my perfectionism has been leading me to take this blog a little more seriously than I should. I&rsquo;d like to start writing smaller, less polished posts more frequently, as opposed to forcing out 2k-word-long vomits whose core theses I get too attached to but can&rsquo;t seem to express properly. Instead, here&rsquo;s to the <a href="https://austinkleon.com/2020/12/10/quantity-leads-to-quality-the-origin-of-a-parable/">pottery parable for prolific work</a> and Alice Maz&rsquo;s recent reminder to me that <a href="https://alicemaz.substack.com/p/you-can-just-do-stuff">I can just do stuff</a>!</p>

      <title>Checkpointing</title>
      <link>https://kewbi.sh/blog/posts/240218/</link>

      <description>On finding reminders to reflect.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Checkpoints are ubiquitous in games. I grew up playing <a href="https://roblox.com">Roblox</a>, and a popular genre of games I&rsquo;d play was &ldquo;obbies&rdquo;, or obstacle courses<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. These had hundreds or thousands of stages, where your blocky character would leap from precariously angled platform to platform. You&rsquo;d dodge the &rsquo;lava&rsquo; tiles and the rotating Wipeout arm, holding your breath until you landed safely on the spawnpoint, emblazoned with a sawblade icon. Sometimes, you wouldn&rsquo;t quite make it: you&rsquo;d clip the edge of an obnoxiously saturated red block. You&rsquo;d teleport back to the previous checkpoint, groan, and start delicately maneuvering again.</p>
<p>Checkpoints in games were primarily used for saving the current state of the game to disk so the player can load it again in the future. I think most people expect savepoints in games nowadays. Games without checkpoints, like Bennett Foddy&rsquo;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Over_It_with_Bennett_Foddy">Getting Over It</a> feel extra frustrating: you make all this progress, only to not have any record of it and no way to get back to where you were before.</p>
<p>Productivity and mindfulness habits like journalling and weekly reviews bring video game checkpoints into our everyday lives. When you think back to the past year, what does your mind land on? Folks naturally fall back on the start and end of projects, new adventures, and major milestones as a sort of personal checkpoint in their life.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s fairly common for people to get caught up in the swing of things, jump from task to task, forget the wins they&rsquo;ve earned, and end up feeling like they haven&rsquo;t made any progress towards their goals and intentions at the end of the year (itself another checkpoint). Explicit checkpoints serve to highlight these landmarks, even if they&rsquo;re not as grandiose as what one set out to accomplish. Just like Roblox obby spawnpoints, checkpoints give us a chance to appreciate the progress we&rsquo;ve made and create opportunities for reflection. Checkpoints let us stop and <em>think</em> a little, before continuing to move forward.</p>
<p>This is a post about framing the ways we self-reflect as checkpoints. While forcibly gamifying productivity is usually a bit of a gimmick, the concept of game checkpoints is one that I think clearly maps to the way our minds center around past milestones.</p>
<h2 id="checkpoints-as-deltas">Checkpoints as Deltas</h2>
<p>Intuitively, checkpoints are like landmarks that demarcate single, instantaneous moments in time. The New Year might be a checkpoint. Graduation, finding your first job, or hitting a milestone of newsletter subscribers might be as well. They&rsquo;re a natural way for your brain to keep track of time and organize events: checkpoint X happened, then next checkpoint Y, and so on. However, I also see checkpoints as a way to visualize progress. To me, checkpoints are more about recalling the deltas in between checkpoints — about reflecting on the journey, not the final destination.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever visited the visual, more artsy, Bullet Journal community, you&rsquo;ll know about habit trackers. The Bullet Journal method is a popular way to organize your planning, and habit trackers are a common extension to the core &lsquo;method&rsquo;. Most folks create grids or bar charts each month with a row for each habit to track and columns for each day, then find creative ways to decorate their tracker throughout the month. Many have noted that the visual cues of the tracker and its presence close to their daily planning pages remind them to complete their habit, if only so they can have the fun of completing a tangible marker of progress. When you&rsquo;re in between checkpoints in Roblox obbies, you want to keep going successfully through to the next checkpoint. With bullet journalling, habit trackers play the same role: people are motivated to make it to the next checkpoint, especially with such a visible reminder each day. Habit trackers serve as progress bars IRL, and the process of creating a new tracker for each month&rsquo;s setup acts as a checkpoint.</p>
<p>Steph Ango&rsquo;s <a href="https://stephango.com/40-questions">40 questions to ask yourself every year</a> is another example of using checkpoints to reflect on deltas. I particularly like question 18: &ldquo;Compared to this time last year, are you: happier or sadder? Thinner or fatter? Richer or poorer?&rdquo; While these are shallow, arbitrary binaries, these questions tacitly invite us to think about the events along the year that caused us to turn out happier (or sadder) and why. Some questions are also rather targetted (question 26: &ldquo;What was your greatest musical discovery of the year?&rdquo;) so your answer might not be from the last few months. I find that I typically suffer from recency bias when reflecting, so questions like these helps to zoom out from the hot new discoveries fresh in my mind from the later bit of the year, to think about my mindset from the beginning of the year. Ango&rsquo;s call for us to complete these questions each year makes the yearly habit a checkpoint and opens up opportunities to compare your life delta across years.</p>
<h2 id="checkpoints-as-interrupts">Checkpoints as Interrupts</h2>
<p>A core idea of Daniel Kahneman&rsquo;s <em>Thinking, Fast and Slow</em> is that our brains operate in two tracks: System 1, the impulsive, fast-acting mode that handles emotional reactions and quick decisions; and System 2, the slow, logical mode that activates when we do deeper thinking and visualize mental models. Our mind&rsquo;s default track is System 1, and part of what Kahneman shows is that it takes some effort to engage System 2. For example, our brains often operate with inherent stereotyping (System 1), and we need to take conscious action and be aware of our biases in order to treat people fairly (System 2).</p>
<p>Productivity checkpoints, like the reflection activities mentioned above, are opportunities for this context switching to occur. It&rsquo;s easy to run in System 1 all the time, but we need some System 2 thinking every so often to learn from our past mistakes. To borrow my operating system class&rsquo;s terminology, checkpoints are hardware interrupts to let our System 2 software run. Checkpoints force a stricter delineation between your typical state of action and a reflective state of mind. Because checkpoints are like landmarks, they&rsquo;re times for us to catch our breath, spinning down System 1 for a bit, which gives System 2 an opportunity to jump in.</p>
<p>Another common productivity habit is the weekly review. I most like Ben Kuhn&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.benkuhn.net/weekly/">take on the process</a>: reading life advice essays that resonate and motivate you, review what happened over the week since the last review (a checkpoint!), then write on a list of impromptu and recurring prompts. Reviewing your progress and reminding yourself about your intentions and goals week-to-week is useful, since otherwise you often forget about your resolutions and get caught up easily in the daily monotony. Even small, granular checkpoints like weekly reviews can be useful — checkpoints aren&rsquo;t just for yearly, exhaustive, or otherwise mentally &rsquo;expensive&rsquo; reflection.</p>
<p>Making checkpoints a habit curiously allows you to leverage your System 1 to shut itself down. By making checkpoints a weekly, recurring process, your System 1 can start to automatically internalize that it needs to let your System 2 get a word in edgewise. This is also why habit trackers seem so effective for folks: filling in the habit tracker becomes a habit, so it feels odd if you haven&rsquo;t completed the habit and can&rsquo;t tick the box.</p>
<h2 id="checkpoint-creation">Checkpoint Creation</h2>
<p>While I was talking through the idea of this post with a good friend, they asked if checkpoints were encountered or actively created. I think there are examples of both. Birthdays, the start of a new quarter, and New Year&rsquo;s are sort of societally imposed checkpoints. You don&rsquo;t choose to pass them by: they&rsquo;re stamped into your calendar as givens. These types of checkpoints are not actively initiated, but are still just as valid for checking in with yourself. As a bonus, their socially recognized nature makes you more likely to be in a thoughtful mood, making it less effortful for your System 2 to take over to reflect.</p>
<p>On the other hand, creating checkpoints via productivity habits for yourself is intentional. These require more activation energy to get started with and to build the habit for: you&rsquo;re doing it for you, and no one is reminding you to commit.</p>
<p>One unique activity I see as a &ldquo;created checkpoint&rdquo; is applying to jobs and programs. I have a personal thesis that people should submit at least one application per year (swap out &lsquo;one&rsquo; and &lsquo;year&rsquo; for the frequency appropriate to your current life phase). Every time I fill in an application for something, I get to really dial in on my values and how they&rsquo;ve changed since the last form I filled out. I take the opportunity to &ldquo;Tell me about yourself&rdquo; to think about what makes me <em>me</em> now, what made me <em>me</em> previously in my last application, and what&rsquo;s changed in between. I add new lines to my resume, remove old ones to make room for new achievements, and reword bullet points to better match what I&rsquo;m interested in now. Each application is one of my checkpoints, and even if I don&rsquo;t get to see what I wrote ever again, I still find it a useful exercise in recalling how I&rsquo;ve grown over time. If you choose to create more reflection checkpoints via this route, a nice side effect is that you&rsquo;ll likely get access to some new resources and opportunities along the way.</p>
<p>Creating checkpoints should be done carefully and mindfully, though. Some checkpoints are more emotionally charged than others. For me, career-focused applications are a delicate balance: I try to be proud of what I&rsquo;ve achieved recently, but find it hard to write about things effectively. (&lsquo;Effectiveness&rsquo; is also subjective here, and depends what my intention for the checkpoint is.) It&rsquo;s hard because you have all the vibes and vague ideas of personal missions and ambitions in your head, but reifying that into words on paper is challenging. For opportunities I&rsquo;m really excited about, I also naturally focus on my successes and spinning my experiences a certain way. If I fill in a form and realize I haven&rsquo;t really done anything new, or that there haven&rsquo;t been any recent relevant achievements, that can feel a little disappointing. This all puts some more stress into the process, which really shouldn&rsquo;t be what checkpoints are about.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I think checkpoints speak to me especially because <a href="https://kewbi.sh/blog/posts/210725/">I&rsquo;m so drawn to lists and neat organization</a>. Framing my personal productivity habits as checkpoints helps me compartmentalize and create structure on which I can reflect. I surround myself with a lot of busy people — there&rsquo;s a whole other discussion to be had on what the point of all this busyness is, but busy people in particular need checkpoints. I know all too well that being busy makes me go into whack-a-mole mode, where I&rsquo;m just putting out fires for the day to day without thinking about my overarching goals. Little checkpoints, like trackers, weekly reviews, and job applications, bring a reminder of intentionality back to my life.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;ll amend my thesis from above: people should create at least one checkpoint each year, just for the sake of having a checkpoint. Checkpoints should be about pushing yourself to break out of your usual cycles of work without taking yourself too seriously. Reflect on how you&rsquo;ve changed and what&rsquo;s fueled that change since the last checkpoint, and take a pause. Then, just like in the Roblox obbies of my childhood: keep going, keep growing, and keep making your way onwards to your next checkpoint.</p>

      <title>Presenting in Figma</title>

      <description>On NeovimConf 2023 and making slides in Figma.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I gave a lightning talk recently at <a href="https://neovimconf.live/">NeovimConf 2023</a>, sharing a bit about my personal notetaking system in Vim. The content of the talk was similar to my previous <a href="https://kewbi.sh/blog/posts/210815/">A Plaintext Zettelkasten</a> post, with less Zettelkasten theory and more Vim keybinds. The conference was streamed live on Twitch, and I got to chat a bit with folks while watching my (prerecorded) talk. Here&rsquo;s the embed:</p>


<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; margin-bottom: 1em">
	<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1a6AEJxH_Dk?si=KuoX7d_z8oiCxX96" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>


<p>I&rsquo;d highly recommend checking out some of the other talks — the talk playlist will be updated <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhlaLyAlbLlr-usEauWLPy4O2ggAvZuKl">here</a>.</p>
<p>People seemed to like my setup and appreciate how I nerded out over it, which was heartwarming<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. I also got some good feedback on my slides&rsquo; aesthetic (you can see them in the video) and a few questions on how I made them.</p>
<p>This is a short post on creating presentations in Figma, with a few links to resources I&rsquo;ve used that might make your design experience a little easier.</p>
<h2 id="why-figma">Why Figma?</h2>
<p>I designed and exported them all in Figma, which I think is a fairly unconventional use for the tool. I&rsquo;ve previously done my Directed Studies (a research course) <a href="https://gist.github.com/kewbish/fcf9f3e4b919a3cb1fa3c889611ce9e2">slides in Figma</a><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> and had good experience doing so. Figma is already the defacto design tool for many web developers, so it&rsquo;s a good choice for presentations too if you have Figma components or libraries you want to reuse.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t use traditional presentation tools like Powerpoint or LibreOffice Impress, since I find it hard to get started with a blank (or very generic) slate. In the past, I&rsquo;ve used Canva for small presentations like these since it has such a vast library of templates — the little things like extra clip art or background assets really makes slides look polished.</p>
<p>I tried Figma for slides recently, first for my Directed Studies slides, then for this lightning talk, because I&rsquo;ve had pre-existing assets in Figma that I wanted to reuse in high quality in my presentations. For my Directed Studies project, I had diagrams from our paper; for my lightning talk, I wanted to use the branding elements from my website, like my gradient and sparkles. Figma makes it easier to design things more precisely than Canva with autolayout, and it&rsquo;s nice to be able to pull from my Figma library without converting to a flat-file image format and back.</p>
<h2 id="workflow">Workflow</h2>
<p>Throughout this post, I&rsquo;ll be using my Directed Studies slides as a running example. Here&rsquo;s what my Figma file looked like:</p>
<figure><img src="/img/231231/figma-overview.png"
         alt="Figure 1. Slides overview"/><figcaption>
            <p><em>Figure 1. Slides overview</em></p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>You can create slides with Frames in Figma. Click the grid Frame icon, or press <!-- raw HTML omitted -->F<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Select <code>Presentation &gt; Slide 16:9</code>.</p>
<p>I like to create a base frame for my slides, so I can have a consistent background. Once you&rsquo;ve designed this, you can select frames and <code>Ctrl-C</code> / <code>Ctrl-V</code> to place them in series. Figma lays them out automatically in a nice line, which makes scrolling through a presentation easier. Creating slides out-of-order is a little more annoying, since you&rsquo;ll have to drag all the frames into line, so I tend to work through my slides in-order.</p>
<p>After I&rsquo;m done with my slides, I use Figma&rsquo;s Prototype tool to wire the transitions up. You can create a new Flow by clicking on your title slide frame, then right-clicking and selecting &lsquo;Add Starting Point&rsquo;. Then, in Prototype mode, you can hover over the side of a frame to wire it to the next slide. I set each transition to &lsquo;On click, navigate to [frame for next slide], instant&rsquo;. There are some animation options available though, like wipes, dissolves, and notably, Smart Animate, which smoothly animates between objects duplicated across frames. This part is a little tedious, but I haven&rsquo;t found a plugin that&rsquo;ll do it for me yet.</p>
<figure><img src="/img/231231/slide-transition.png"
         alt="Figure 2. Transitioning between slides"/><figcaption>
            <p><em>Figure 2. Transitioning between slides</em></p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Finally, you can present with the Play button in the upper-right hand corner. You can move between slides with the arrow keys, as in Powerpoint.</p>
<figure><img src="/img/231231/press-play.gif"
         alt="Figure 3. Demoing the presentation"/><figcaption>
            <p><em>Figure 3. Demoing the presentation</em></p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>You can also export each slide as a PNG by selecting all your frames and heading to <code>Design &gt; Export &gt; PNG &gt; Export X layers</code>. I used this in my NeovimConf talk, as I recorded my webcam separately from my slides.</p>
<h2 id="miscellaneous-tips">Miscellaneous Tips</h2>
<p>For in-slide animations, I duplicated a slide multiple times and added Prototype transitions between each subpart of the slide. I used this for animating bullet points that appeared on each keypress. You might be able to implement this more efficiently with Variables, but I typically only have at most three subparts per slide, so I haven&rsquo;t explored this yet.</p>
<figure><img src="/img/231231/inslide-transition.png"
         alt="Figure 4. Not a very DRY presentation"/><figcaption>
            <p><em>Figure 4. Not a very DRY presentation</em></p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>For page numbering, I&rsquo;ve used <a href="https://www.hypermatic.com/pitchdeck/">Pitchdeck</a>, a Figma plugin, in the past. You can add the plugin normally via the Figma Components menu, but beware some features like PDF export and such are paywalled. Pitchdeck is quite fully-featured and appears to do the in-slide animations I&rsquo;d be looking for, but I found their interface unintuitive and a little overpowered for my needs.</p>
<p>To add slide numbering, open Pitchdeck and click the Page icon in the upper-left of the plugin window. Toggle &lsquo;Enable auto slide numbers&rsquo; to on. You can customize slide numbering styling here as well, which I think is a nice way to tie into the rest of your presentation branding. If you&rsquo;re using my janky method of duplicating slides for in-slide animations, Pitchdeck will see each individual frame as a new slide to number, so I resorted to deleting everything except the last subpart of my animation, running the auto-slide numbers, then recreating my animation. Try to add slide numbers once at the very end if you forsee this happening.</p>
<figure><img src="/img/231231/pitchdeck-numbering.png"

<p>A parting tip I&rsquo;d give is that it really helps if little things like asset theming ties in well together. I was able to reuse the metallic gradient I use for titles on this blog (see this article header) for my titles as well as for my webcam frame and its decorations<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m far from a Figma power user, but it&rsquo;s fairly easy to create cohesive presentations in Figma even with basic tools. I&rsquo;d love to reuse my NeovimConf template for future talks (with different content, of course!)</p>
<p>Speaking of speaking, I&rsquo;d like to apply for more opportunities in 2024. Writing and rehearsing my NeovimConf talk was a great learning experience in terms of Vim content, even though I&rsquo;d already done quite a bit of tinkering myself, not to mention very validating to get to chat with other Neovim-adjacent folks and be able to share a bit about my unique workflows. I have a lot to learn in terms of storytelling and talk structure — I got feedback from a friend mentioning how they thought I was listing off keymaps without showing how they fit together well in a system. Figuring out how to explain things you&rsquo;re passionate about in an accessible way is trickier than it seems, especially since you have all the pictures and mental models in your head and it&rsquo;s easy to assume others do too. Public speaking is also far out of my comfort zone. This was a pre-recorded talk, but I&rsquo;d like to challenge myself to give something live if I have the opportunity.</p>
<p>Thank you again to the NeovimConf team for putting together and hosting such a fun conference! I met plenty of fellow Vim nerds and learned many fun tricks, and all in all had a great time. Can&rsquo;t wait to rewatch the talks and see what NeovimConf 2024 holds!</p>

      <title>End-Of-Life</title>

      <description>On bitrot, deprecation, and deletion.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking about mortality and longevity recently. Today, I&rsquo;d like to think about durability of our data, the lifespan of the websites we rely on, and the process of software reaching End-Of-Life.</p>
<p>A natural final destination for software is deprecation and deletion. Sure, some mission-critical software will stay in use for decades to come, but even the essential tools of the 70s have been replaced just fifty years later. This is understandable, since computer science is such a young field, but during this evolution, I&rsquo;m sure many lines of BASIC, Pascal, and all those languages now regarded as ancient have been wiped and lost to time.</p>
<p>There are initiatives that aim to prevent or delay that from happening. The <a href="https://archive.org/">Internet Archive</a> is perhaps the most well-known example of this I can think of. The <a href="https://archiveprogram.github.com/arctic-vault/">GitHub Arctic Vault</a> program similarly strives to preserve current-day code as far into the future as possible. In 2020, all active public repos were archived into an Arctic vault, deep in the permafrost. I&rsquo;ll note, though, that GitHub&rsquo;s own site points to the possibility of climate change affecting the storage site (albeit only a thin layer of the permafrost under which the vault lies) among other factors.</p>
<p>Even if our data far outlasts us, is there value in holding onto it beyond historical curiosity? I think sentimentality can apply to software too. We all have childhood memories that have deeply affected us, so it makes sense that our data and the software we hold dear would as well. In this post, I&rsquo;ll primarily discuss personal data and websites, since I&rsquo;ve seen more examples of them experiencing this slow EOL, but there are parallels to be drawn with binary software and hardware as well.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s painful to watch things we care about fade into obscurity, then stop working or lack support, then enter the digital ether. Same goes for people. Just as we reflect on the impact of those who have passed away on our own lives, I think it&rsquo;s interesting to think about how the makeup of our toolkits will shift as software hits its EOL.</p>
<h2 id="elementary-my-dear-watson">Elementary, my dear Watson</h2>
<p>I named my first laptop Watson. I got it in the summer before sixth grade, and used it almost til my senior year of high school. The summer before I started high school, I dual-booted Watson (originally running Windows) with Linux, and I quickly turned to using Linux daily over Windows.</p>
<p>However, at some point after I dual-booted with Linux, my Windows became completely sluggish. Logging in would take about three minutes. When it&rsquo;d finally load, I&rsquo;d get a black screen with just a cursor, and even the shortcuts to open Task Manager weren&rsquo;t working.</p>
<p>About a year ago, my dad&rsquo;s laptop, a very old Toshiba bought not long after I was born, also started slowing down. I volunteered my old laptop, Watson, for him to use, and set to getting it ready for him.</p>
<p>I was trying to fix the Windows partition of my system while only reformatting what was necessary. I&rsquo;d transferred over the contents of my Linux partition to my new device, so there was no sentimentality there, but there were still some old screenshots and game files on the Windows side that I&rsquo;d have preferred to keep. Over the course of a month, I tried to fix Windows without wiping everything. I&rsquo;d never looked at those files after switching to Linux, and I don&rsquo;t know why I was so attached to them. In the end, in a Herculean display of rationality, I wiped it all and factory reset my laptop. It works now, and my dad&rsquo;s happy with his &rsquo;new&rsquo; machine. I still think about what I&rsquo;ve lost in that process though — the files that were on that drive that I&rsquo;ll never get back.</p>
<p>Computers have afforded both digital abundance and digital hoarding. There are few reasons not to just hang onto everything, and it feels <em>wrong</em> to let files go. Just buy a hard disk and copy files over, regardless of if you&rsquo;ll look at them again. There&rsquo;s a niggling voice in my head wanting to keep things around for the sake of some nebulous &lsquo;future me&rsquo;. There are folks that seem to have similar hangups: I have a systems professor who said that every time his disk gets close to filling up, he buys a new laptop with twice as much storage and copies everything over. Per Murphy&rsquo;s law, it&rsquo;s worked out okay so far.</p>
<p>The files I deleted on my Windows drive were from my formative years of learning to use a computer. I weirdly sometimes want them back as keepsakes of how much I&rsquo;ve grown, but I think I&rsquo;m coming to terms with the fact that knowing I&rsquo;ve had those experiences is enough. Yet it still feels wrong to hard-delete files, like I&rsquo;m actively cutting the lifespan of my data short.</p>
<p>Even if you&rsquo;re not the one pulling the trigger and hitting <code>Del</code>, I wonder how much data online is continuously being lost passively. It doesn&rsquo;t make financial sense to retain records forever — data is cheap, but at scale, I realize that storing it can add up. Google is deleting inactive Gmail accounts, and reportedly, so does Instagram. This, more passive, type of deletion is also interesting to consider — it&rsquo;s like the data is slowly marching towards its deletion.</p>
<p>Today, there are on the order of 120 zettabytes (2^70 bytes) of data in the world, but I don&rsquo;t know if this statistic accounts for deleted or inactive data. That&rsquo;s more difficult to estimate, but if there&rsquo;s 330 million terabytes of data created per day, there&rsquo;s got to be at least a few million deleted. I wonder what we lose each day. The 330 million terabytes is primarily video data, so there&rsquo;s probably plenty of old video content in what&rsquo;s deleted, but perhaps some meaningful software too.</p>
<h2 id="davids-ipad">David&rsquo;s iPad</h2>
<p>My family still has one of the original iPad Airs from a company gift almost a decade ago. The limited set of apps I use runs perfectly fine, and for the most part websites work alright too. But as the web, or really, JavaScript standards, move onwards, website after website has stopped quite working as it used to. Reddit doesn&rsquo;t load comments, ad-heavy recipe sites keep throwing &lsquo;A problem repeatedly occurred&rsquo;, and a class of sites that appear to be using React show the same slap in the face: &lsquo;Application error&rsquo; and &lsquo;Browser not supported&rsquo;.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m for change and innovation in the web space. As someone who&rsquo;s blindly thrown ES2023 features into code without worrying too much about browser support or interoperability, I get it. It&rsquo;s not the fault of web maintainers in any way. Yet it feels odd to have that reminder that things on the Internet aren&rsquo;t here, in the same state that they are now, accessible in the same ways they are now, forever.</p>
<p>The rest of my devices are fairly up-to-date, so I haven&rsquo;t suffered too much from device support issues beyond using this old iPad. It&rsquo;s a good reminder to me, though, that even if software sticks around for a long time, the hardware we have may not always fully support it. GitHub has decided to archive so many repositories in its Arctic Code Vault: in the future, will we even have the hardware to run it? We&rsquo;ll have to rely on emulators and apocryphal knowledge of processor, browser, and operating system quirks.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="this-domain-is-for-sale">This domain is for sale</h2>
<p>To keep software innovating, sometimes we can&rsquo;t support all devices. To some extent, that&rsquo;s acceptable. The core functionality still works, we get new devices, the world goes on. But what happens when the app itself goes down?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s websites out there that were in a &lsquo;it works now but don&rsquo;t touch it&rsquo; state, abandoned or forgotten. I came across <a href="https://stablequarters.org/">this equine center site</a> that appeared to use to have live horse cams, which are understandably no longer activated, as the center shut down in 2018. I wonder how the site&rsquo;s still running, five years later. Granted, it&rsquo;s very Web 1.0, so I doubt there were many critical dependencies, but the domain and hosting&rsquo;s still up.</p>
<p>Sites like these suffer from something similar to, but not entirely like, bit rot. With bit rot, functionality itself glitches or corrupts, but here it&rsquo;s like piece by piece of the site fades away. First the outlinks die, then some iframe source no longer connects, and so on. Because of backwards compatibility, most things keep working, so it&rsquo;s like a slowly decaying time capsule with a ticking timer for when it&rsquo;ll disappear.</p>
<p>Archive.org does a good job at capturing most sites on the internet to preserve snapshots before they go down, but they don&rsquo;t capture the full interactivity of pages. Outlinks aren&rsquo;t captured by default, so even if a page loads, we might not be able to access the websites in its latent space. As well, apps that require authentication won&rsquo;t get captured. Fifty years down the line, we&rsquo;ll only have screenshots and video recordings left.</p>
<p>As well, hosting costs someone somewhere money, even if it&rsquo;s ostensibly offered for free, so it makes sense that apps aren&rsquo;t hosted forever either. However, it&rsquo;s a lot easier to justify keeping an app up if it&rsquo;s running for free, as was possible with Heroku and its competitors. I&rsquo;d be interested in an estimate of what small percentage of the Internet <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> took down just by removing its free tier. It&rsquo;s likely small, but biased towards personal passion projects. I&rsquo;d think work like this is highly sentimental to their creators, but perhaps not so much so that it&rsquo;s worth spending extra on hosting<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Finally, I&rsquo;d like to consider domain names. It&rsquo;s impossible to buy a domain name forever — we&rsquo;re just renting them by the year<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. Gilles Castel, notable for their Vim + LaTeX notetaking workflow, unfortunately passed away in 2022, but <a href="https://castel.dev">their site</a> remains up. Perhaps they prepaid for a domain for many years, or perhaps someone close is taking care of the registration for them. I can&rsquo;t help but wonder what happens as long-held domains and hosting plans expire, particularly for proprietary websites where the original source may be lost entirely.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>One open-source project that inspired many of the deprecation-related thoughts in this post is <a href="https://github.com/jdecked/twemoji/">twemoji</a>, Twitter&rsquo;s signature emoji library, now forked from the prior Twitter open-source project. A few months ago, I saw <a href="https://github.com/twitter/twemoji/issues/570">this issue</a>, noting that there were problems with licensing prior emoji assets for reuse, so the project would stagnate. I use Twemoji as my default emoji font, and I realized that while previously released emojis would still work, more and more emojis would appear as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noto_fonts#Etymology">tofus</a> as time went on. I would literally be able to see the font decay.</p>
<p>Happily though, <a href="https://github.com/jdecked/twemoji/pull/51">this PR</a> recently got merged with the Unicode 15.0 updates and what I assume was approval from Twitter to continue the project. It&rsquo;s still a volunteer-run effort, but Discord as a company seems invested in contributing, so I&rsquo;m optimistic that Twemoji will continue to be updated until the inevitable process of software EOL kicks in yet again.</p>
<p>My dad once very thoughtfully reflected that everything needs maintenance: health, physical objects, relationships. So does software. When there&rsquo;s no one there, or no more resources available, to maintain it, the metaphorical health of the sites we frequent today will begin to decline. Eventually, we won&rsquo;t be able to locate them anymore, when their domains expire; to run them anymore, when their backends stop being hosted or our new processors ditch support. I&rsquo;d reckon they&rsquo;ll eventually all be deleted as well, despite our best efforts to memorialize and archive them.</p>
<p>As they say, though, such is life. While our software still runs (or hobbles along) for us today, we can learn to appreciate its quirks and the marks it&rsquo;s left on us. They say life is fleeting, and maybe it&rsquo;s okay that software is too.</p>

      <title>Serialization</title>

      <description>On reducing dimensions and preserving semantics.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>I remember when I first started learning Python and realized what an <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0498/">f-string</a> was. It was mind-blowing to me back then that not only could you print variables in a certain format, but also modify those variables and do other computation within the brackets, and get it to all display nicely. I was amazed that I could get variables of all different types to pretty-print themselves with an f-string.</p>
<p>I now know that under the hood, the f-string formatting is just calling <code>__str__()</code>, and that all the types I tried just had good <code>__str__()</code>s defined. This is an example of serialization: formally, transforming an object to a different representation so it can be saved to disk or transmitted over the wire. I like to think of it as dimension reduction in a representation — kind of like squashing a cube into a square, or in this case taking a photo of the cube (converting it into 2D data) to be faxed<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. To bring this dimension reduction back to Python, if I ran the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-py" data-lang="py"><span style="display:flex;"><span>dict <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> {<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;a&#34;</span>: <span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>, <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;b&#34;</span>: <span style="color:#ae81ff">2</span>}
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>print(<span style="color:#e6db74">f</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;</span><span style="color:#e6db74">{</span>dict<span style="color:#e6db74">}</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;</span>)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>I&rsquo;d get <code>{&quot;a&quot;: 1, &quot;b&quot;: 2}</code> as the output. This converts the dictionary into a string so it can be transmitted via printing, but in doing so, the string loses some of the properties of the original dictionary. You can&rsquo;t call <code>.items()</code> on the string, nor can you add new key-value pairs. During serialization, the object&rsquo;s lost some of its intrinsic properties while retaining the same core information.</p>
<p>This is an interesting problem (feature?) of serialization, and it&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;d like to explore further, especially in the context of exporting metadata from apps and tool interoperability. In this post, I&rsquo;ll dive into JavaScript&rsquo;s infamous <code>[object Object]</code>, JavaScript&rsquo;s JSON serialization, and alternative serialization methods, like dehydration of data, before pivoting a little into what it means to really own our data (spoiler alert: it has to do with serialization too!)</p>
<h2 id="object-object">[object Object]</h2>
<p>I was once helping <a href="https://maplebacon.org/">Maple Bacon</a> run their UBC-specific CTF, SaplingCTF. I was working primarily on the CTFd theme, and for this iteration of SaplingCTF in particular, I was trying to get some custom styling working for progression challenges. I thought I had it all working, until things inevitably broke during the competition and I had to do some debugging and hotfixing. While trying to deploy a fix as soon as possible, I left an <code>alert(obj)</code> in there somewhere, which meant that each time someone reloaded the challenge page they&rsquo;d be greeted with <code>[object Object]</code>. Not my best work.</p>
<p><code>[object Object]</code> has been ubiquitous in my JavaScript experiences. Forgot to wrap something in <code>JSON.stringify()</code> before <code>console.log()</code>-ing it? <code>[object Object]</code><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p><code>[object Object]</code> comes from the <code>Object</code>&rsquo;s prototype&rsquo;s <code>toString()</code> method returning <code>[object Object]</code>. Functions get serialized as <code>[object Function]</code> and date objects as <code>[object Date]</code>. While all of these are objects, the second word in their serialization depends on their constructor type.</p>
<p>But this all changes if you <code>JSON.stringify()</code> the object. If you try it on <code>{}</code>, you&rsquo;ll get <code>&quot;{}&quot;</code>. If you try it on a date, you&rsquo;ll get a date. What gives?</p>
<p>For one, <code>Date</code>s implement the <code>toJSON()</code> method, so <code>JSON.stringify()</code> knows to show the ISO representation of the date as its serialized value. In general, properties that have <code>.toJSON()</code> will have that method called to determine how to serialize them, and others, like <code>undefined</code>, <code>Map</code>s, and <code>Set</code>s, will be ignored. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify#description">MDN</a> has more about the specifics of the algorithm here.</p>
<p>I recently learned that you can also provide your own <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify#the_replacer_parameter">replacer function</a> to <code>JSON.stringify()</code> to tell it how to serialize certain types, like <code>ArrayBuffer</code>s or the aforementioned <code>Map</code>s and <code>Set</code>s. It&rsquo;s called on the object being stringified, then called recursively on each of the object&rsquo;s properties. You can check the type of the object (e.g. <code>object instanceof SpecialClass</code>) and return a value satisfactorily serializing the object&rsquo;s properties to be included into the JSON. <code>JSON.parse()</code> also has a reciprocal function called the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse#using_the_reviver_parameter">reviver function</a>. This is useful for including things like <code>Set</code>s in a JSON string, which I typically serialize as an array and rebuild into a <code>Set</code> on the other side.</p>
<h2 id="serialization-in-the-wild">Serialization in the Wild</h2>
<p>There are other ways to approach serialization in JavaScript that avoid having to create your own custom reducers for common datatypes and that handle cyclical references well. For example, Cloudflare&rsquo;s local Workers simulator, <code>miniflare</code>, uses <a href="https://github.com/Rich-Harris/devalue"><code>devalue</code></a> to flatten objects representing Workers abstractions into JSON so they can be piped through to different parts of the simulator<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. <code>devalue</code> brings support for <code>JSON.stringify</code>ing common objects like <code>Map</code>s and handles cyclical references, which you&rsquo;d otherwise have to write replacer functions for. A nice bonus is that it can even unflatten values that are part of a larger string. This is called rehydration: if we think of serializing values as vacuum-packing and drying food for easier storage and later consumption, rehydration is the &lsquo;just add water&rsquo; part of eating the MREs. While using it, I noted that <code>devalue</code> has some pretty neat raw output as well. If I recall correctly, it outputs seemingly nonsensical nested arrays of numbers and string keys — think something like <code>[[0, &quot;a&quot;, []], &quot;b&quot;]</code>. The project goals state that it&rsquo;s intentionally not human readable, but it&rsquo;s interesting that if you squinted hard enough, you can kinda tell where the structure comes from.</p>
<p>On the more theoretical PL side, I also recently learned about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunk">thunks</a>. Thunks are a way to delay evaluation of an expensive function (and historically, to delay evaluation of its arguments) until later. In JavaScript, they can be implemented quite easily with arrow functions wrapping some function with other arguments and passing the variable name of the thunk around.</p>

</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>Thunks are mostly used to avoid executing code, but I&rsquo;ve seen them used in serializing expensive or unreliable function results as well. I was <a href="https://github.com/jepsen-io/maelstrom/blob/main/doc/05-datomic/03-persistent-trees.md">optimizing a toy distributed KV store</a> recently and I was using &rsquo;thunks&rsquo; to store mappings of unique IDs to values. This let me only occasionally retrieve the underlying values when needed to hydrate parts of the KV map while keeping other parts unevaluated and ready for computation later. To me, thunks feel like a type of serialization too, since they package up a function in a representation for use (evaluation) in another context. However, since they&rsquo;re usually implemented with basic built-in language features and are usually never read in their bytecode form outside of the program&rsquo;s execution, maybe this one&rsquo;s a bit of a stretch.</p>
<p>While Python&rsquo;s <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html">pickling</a> is in an entirely different language, it also bears mentioning in a post about serialization. This past semester, I was working on a research project that had been started by another student the summer before. <a href="https://github.com/ubcdlab/pr-issue-topology-project">The project</a> involved a lot of web scraping and I wasn&rsquo;t looking forward to having to do it again, but the previous student had the foresight to save all the scraped Python objects as pickles! This made it incredibly easy to load in a big class object and start manipulating data. The scraping had also been performed with the help of some other libraries, and Pickle preserves the functions defined on each object, so even without the libraries installed I was able to call basic functions and get started quickly.</p>
<p>Pickling in Python is the richest form of serialization I&rsquo;ve worked with yet - the fact that the object and all its properties and functions can be recreated from a simple file means that none of the original data or behaviour is lost. At the start of this article, I mentioned how serialization often feels like dimension reduction: after data is serialized, it typically loses some behaviour or some data attributes, even if it&rsquo;s parsed and reconstructed later. Pickling makes serialization without this reduction practical.</p>
<p>A section on the forms of serialization I&rsquo;ve encountered so far wouldn&rsquo;t be complete without a final little hat-tip to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racket_(programming_language)">Racket</a> and its Lispy concepts of data as code and code as data with S-expressions. I can&rsquo;t put it into words, but there seems to be something intrinsically connecting the concepts of serializability and having your code live as data and vice versa.</p>
<h2 id="iframe-pickling-the-web"><code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>: Pickling the Web</h2>
<p>If serializing is converting something into a form that can be transmitted, there&rsquo;s also something interesting in primitives that don&rsquo;t have to be converted to be transmitted. Pickling is one such modality, but so are <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>s. Pardon my continual gross misuse of &ldquo;serialization&rdquo;, but I also think <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> embed tags are, if not a form of serialization, at least something very closely adjacent. They&rsquo;re arguably one of the most ubiquitous and well-embedded (pun not intended) on the web. They were introduced in 1997<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> (after Python&rsquo;s <code>pickle</code> was implemented!)</p>
<p>In some ways, they&rsquo;re similar to pickle files — they preserve the entire functionality of the object and allow the site to be integrated into the rest of another object. They enable websites to be part of each other in a rich way like pickle files, with some extra strict container boundaries for security.</p>
<p>On the other hand, they&rsquo;re not persistent like pickle files, even if the hosting website is a local file. They depend on the current iteration of the website, and if the embedded site goes down, the hosting site won&rsquo;t display properly as well. You could embed an <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> to the <code>archive.org</code> as well, but that might not necessarily reflect the most recent updates to the site. Maybe embedding an <code>archive.org</code> link is somewhat closer to serialization than live <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>s.</p>
<h2 id="tool-interoperability">Tool Interoperability</h2>
<p>At the core of serialization is the idea that data <em>moves</em>: between scripts (Pickling), between obscured code and developer-facing output (JSON), and between domains on the web (<code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>s). We&rsquo;ve seen in this post all the ways serialization can enable interesting theoretical behaviour, but what happens in the real world?</p>
<p>I think serialization-forward software is almost necessarily at odds with the walled-garden, mystery-cloud approach of most SaaS tools. Nowadays, most tools support some way to export your data, but moving between software typically causes you to lose something. I once did a big migration from OneNote to raw Markdown, which, to state the obvious, meant losing all my image positioning, coloured highlights, and so on. That&rsquo;s a big fidelity jump, so I&rsquo;ll forgive OneNote, but there&rsquo;s so many more examples online. You can export webpages to PDF, losing easy access to their hyperlinks or to interactive media. Depending on the service, exports can range from CSVs to JSON — you might get all the required data for your use case, but you also might not. You&rsquo;ll certainly have to recreate the underlying functionality of the data, or find a tool to do so. If you find another app and switch, it&rsquo;ll often take significant work to convert to the serialization format expected by the new program.</p>
<p>Serialization, and ways to extract rich metadata, is key for true interoperability. In an ideal world, we&rsquo;d also be able to get some base idea of the object&rsquo;s original interactivity models. Today, we&rsquo;re stuck with copy-and-pasting raw unformatted text and taking static screenshots that don&rsquo;t encode any of a tool&rsquo;s behaviour.</p>
<p>The performance of ways to do this is another issue to tackle. To enable a practical workflow where you&rsquo;re able to switch seamlessly between apps, your context-switching processing time should be as low as possible. This is a challenge when you&rsquo;ll likely have to convert between file formats and reconcile differences in structure on the fly, all of which appear very expensive time-wise.</p>
<p>I see aspects of this interoperability in tools already — MS Word allows you to embed and interact with MS Excel charts, for example. There are also a plethora of sketchy scripts on GitHub that allow you to convert and import between tools. But they lack the authoritative support, polish, and ease of use that I think are necessary to bring this potential ecosystem together.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Serialization and representation are so closely intertwined that if I ran <code>s/serialize/represent/g</code> on this post it&rsquo;d still make sense (and I&rsquo;d still have to apologize for my overly stretched usage of either word). I don&rsquo;t know how to differentiate between them, and I think in this post I&rsquo;ve mixed both up and added a few more tablespoons of general interest in data to boot.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m interested in thinking about more open ways to move data around, relying perhaps on more easily serialized forms of data, like JSON, and figuring out how to codify original behaviour or intent. Ink And Switch&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/potluck/">Potluck</a> and <a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/cambria/">Cambria</a> projects both fit closely to this space, and I&rsquo;ve also been inspired by Alexander Obenauer&rsquo;s <a href="https://alexanderobenauer.com/labnotes/002/">idea of universal data portability</a> and thoughts on <a href="https://alexanderobenauer.com/labnotes/000/#:~:text=Having%20fun%20with%20item%20views">data views</a>. <a href="https://streamlit.io/">Streamlit</a>, a Python framework to build data-based apps, seems like an adjacent step towards what I&rsquo;m envisioning as well. I&rsquo;d like to dive specifically into how to represent original intent at a rich level sometime — we&rsquo;ll see what comes out of that thought.</p>
<p>Also, on a final note, I&rsquo;ll be giving a lightning talk at <a href="https://neovimconf.live/">Neovimconf 2023</a> about my personal knowledge management system in Vim! Tickets are free, so tune in on December 8th, 2023 if you&rsquo;re interested in learning more about taking notes with Vim, a little splash of Ripgrep, and some FZF.vim too.</p>

<p>By &lsquo;dimension&rsquo; here, I mean one &lsquo;aspect&rsquo; or &lsquo;axis&rsquo; of data. I loosely also include &rsquo;the ability to do something&rsquo; - something like an instance function - as a dimension. I think the term &lsquo;dimension&rsquo; is probably overloaded here, and there&rsquo;s probably a better way to express this sort of &lsquo;squishing&rsquo;.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>This mistake once derailed an entire hackathon project for about 6 of the 36 hours.

<p>When I was working on updating <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/miniflare/pull/641">the Queues implementation</a>, I looked into it for sending the Queue&rsquo;s messages around. To be honest, when making the PR, all the serialization and buffer manipulation felt a bit like black magic, primarily because I was unfamiliar with how Buffers and ArrayBuffers worked. Learning more of the JS internals, like this, is something I want to improve at.&#160;<a href="#fnref:3" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
