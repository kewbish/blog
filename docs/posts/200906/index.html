                <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>As you may have guessed from the title of this blog post, I have switched to Linux. And no, not Arch Linux - though I guess Manjaro is close. Specifically, XFCE Manjaro (and I&rsquo;ve also been experimenting with i3).</p>
<p>Before this, I was on Windows (yes, Windows, no need to pull all the &lsquo;but development&rsquo; cards) and WSL. I had a very strange split where most of my development things (like Python packages, programs, scripts) would be on the Windows side, and then only the programs that I absolutely <em>needed</em> from Bash and WSL (like C compilers for <a href="https://kewbish.github.io/blog/posts/200621/">CS50</a> and vim) on WSL. However, I&rsquo;ve been recently having to lean more on the WSL side, and having dependencies on both sides was a little annoying to manage. For example, I wanted to try Vim and configuring autocomplete with Python there, but the problem was, I needed the packages to be on the WSL side.</p>
<p>As well, I find myself surrounded by a lot of people who use Linux (specifically Arch evangelists), and their constant harping on about this super cool program and that interesting configuration made me curious. I wanted to see what it was like, and I&rsquo;d been spending a lot of time browsing <a href="https://reddit.com/r/unixporn">shiny rices on Reddit</a>. I don&rsquo;t think Windows has a proper tiling manager, and I didn&rsquo;t feel like trying to set up X sessions on Windows. While it&rsquo;s possible, I felt that it&rsquo;d be easier (and more fun besides) to just try installing Linux.</p>
<h2 id="day--">Day -âˆž</h2>
<p>Leading up to the install, which I kept putting off, I spent a decent amount of time researching how to dual boot, partition, configure Linux, and choosing a distro. Various <a href="https://distrochooser.de/">distro quizzes</a> (yes, somewhat cringe) and recommendations led me to Manjaro. It has the configurability of Arch, while having a GUI installer and being less of a pain to install (according to several blog posts, which were extremely reliable sources of information) than pure Arch. I didn&rsquo;t want to go with Ubuntu<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> either, and based on several (probably biased) articles, I decided that Manjaro would be the happy medium.</p>
<p>I also was thinking about KDE versus just a tiling WM, but I decided to go with XFCE (also with the help of several probably biased articles). It&rsquo;d provide graphical options, and would probably make it easier to transition from Windows and its infinitely explorable menus to the already unfamiliar Linux. I liked the idea of a tiling WM, but reading that it didn&rsquo;t provide the same shiny menus to click through was a bit off-putting. After a while, I also installed i3, but more on that later.</p>
<p>And of course, I wanted to experience the ever-mentioned Vim in its full glory. I&rsquo;d tried it in WSL so this wasn&rsquo;t <em>too</em> much of a leap, but it was a situation and a half getting used to no VSCode and just terminal.</p>
<h2 id="day-1">Day 1</h2>
<p>Day 1 was a fine Thursday - just after Hack The 6ix, where I really wanted to just spend some time doing mindless work that&rsquo;d work without headaches (spoiler alert: it wasn&rsquo;t entirely that, but it&rsquo;s fine). In the morning, I backed up all my old data (in the case of unfortunate fat-fingering) and while that was happening, I burned the ISO.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>After backing things up and doing some last minute research, I finally booted to the USB and followed <a href="https://forum.manjaro.org/t/howto-dual-boot-manjaro-and-windows/1164">this very fine guide</a> on the Manjaro forum.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> I only shrunk my Windows partition by maybe half (this is important for Day 2), but besides that I was pretty proud of myself. I was quite pleasantly surprised that I ended up not messing anything major up, and the entire installation was done in 15 minutes.</p>
<p>For the remainder of today, I mostly messed around with terminal settings, and trying to explore XFCE settings. I managed to import my Chrome history and also set up a theme. I did a bit of terminal theming tweaking, and messing around with LightDM backgrounds. Didn&rsquo;t really do much to mess things up, just a lot of installing. I was also pleasantly surprised how fast things and packages download on Linux, and how relatively easy pacman was to use.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="day-2">Day 2</h2>
<p>In the morning, I did a bit of schoolwork, and in the background, tried to install more packages. In the meantime though, I also realized that I would really be on Windows much, given that Linux seemed to be alright for everything except an office suite (which I have now but not at the time). So - I tried to resize partitions. (This is where the bit about partitions from last section comes into play). This is what my partitions approximately looked like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">||| windows things ||| linux things + + |
</code></pre></div><p>The Linux side had about half, and I wanted to make it more like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">||| win ||| lots of linux space         |
</code></pre></div><p>Essentially, more space. The problem was, I didn&rsquo;t know how to rearrange the space after shrinking Windows to move capacity to the home directory. I realize now that I could probably have just formatted the other directories and kept home, but I didn&rsquo;t know that then. In my defense, I hadn&rsquo;t realized that yet. So, I got the trusty Manjaro USB out again - and reinstalled. This unfortunately wiped a lot of my packages, so I had to reinstall things yet again. Unfortunate.</p>
<p>At least this time round, it was a lot easier to get things set up the way I&rsquo;d like - I knew where each of the relevant settings were, and I even set up OneDrive properly this time. It was very tedious to reinstall everything <em>yet again</em>, but in the grand scheme of things, I spent more time configuring each and removing unneeded packages.</p>
<h2 id="day-3">Day 3</h2>
<p>Today, I was messing around with power settings and things, and I found that normal Chrome was using a bunch of resources relative to the other programs, at least according to powertop. I did some research, and apparently it was due to YouTube and GPU decoding videos. It wasn&rsquo;t really enough to be noticeable, but I was interested in trying to tweak it anyway. So, I (tried to) download Chromium from pamac. I thought it wouldn&rsquo;t do anything major - just another install. (Spoiler alert: I was wrong.)</p>
<p>It was a pretty big install, so I just did more work and let it run in the background. However, once I finished a problem or two and I was checking on the install progress, I realized it was stuck. What&rsquo;s more, when I tried to close pamac (bad idea #1) just by exiting, it didn&rsquo;t close. Huh. I then tried to force quit it through processes (bad idea #2). It did close, but before that, I noticed that it was stuck particularly on &lsquo;Updating grub menu&rsquo;. In hindsight, that was probably a very bad idea. But I go about my day, and after finishing work, I shut down (kinda bad idea #3).</p>
<p>When I tried to boot my laptop again, I noticed that Manjaro&rsquo;s bootloader kept getting stuck on the HP logo screen, where the spinner would appear for a while, and it&rsquo;d go dark as if it were properly booting, but then getting stuck in a loop again. I thought it was an issue with the partition things I&rsquo;d done yesterday, so I re-enter the Manjaro boot live environment. Problem was, it was stuck waiting for a module forever. (Actually not forever, I was just impatient.)</p>
<p>I then tried booting into Windows, but for some reason, that was extremely slow and things weren&rsquo;t opening properly. I was pretty stuck on this, but then a friend donated a Manjaro wiki<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> link. It detailed some grub menu fixes, which I attempted to do, but by then, the live USB had managed to fix itself (I guess turning things on and off again does somehow fix things), and I just ended up formatting every partition except my home, which I kept.</p>
<p>Cue a couple minutes of waiting, and then tedious reinstalls. After this though, I managed to not break my system (fingers crossed I don&rsquo;t manage to break it again), and I&rsquo;ve been fiddling for the past few days, tweaking configuration files and the like.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In the future, I&rsquo;m going to continue configuring i3 (which I also installed, just to see what a tiling manager was like) and try to set this up just as I like it. I&rsquo;d like to fix the status bar to be not <em>quite</em> so colourful and information-full, and make the window tabs a different colour and design. I&rsquo;m still lurking a lot on various ricing subreddits, and it&rsquo;s quite inspiring to see how creative people are. I don&rsquo;t want to invest <em>too</em> much time into ricing, but I can tell I&rsquo;m going to be spending a while on it already. In addition, I&rsquo;d like to make all my colourschemes nice and greyscale, and maybe properly set up my dotfiles.</p>
<p>In case you wanted a screenshot, here&rsquo;s how my desktop looks at the moment (yes, this is a metascreenshot):</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m actually pretty pleased with what I&rsquo;ve managed to learn and create in the past week or so. It&rsquo;s quite bare - mostly just the default i3 config. I&rsquo;d like to &lsquo;rice&rsquo; it some more (apparently that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s called), and I feel like I&rsquo;ve learned a lot from repeatedly breaking my system three times in as many days. I can definitely see why Linux users get so superiorist about it - it&rsquo;s very easy to customize and I think I&rsquo;ll be trying to make this system as bespoke and shiny as I possibly can.</p>
<h2 id="currently">Currently</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been finishing up a lot of small projects recently, and I&rsquo;d like to finally get to a more long-term project. I&rsquo;m thinking about creating a Chip-8 emulator, just to learn about CPUs and virtual machines / emulator development and things of that sort. I have an old Kano Pixel kit that I honestly haven&rsquo;t touched in roundabout 2 years, but they&rsquo;ve come up with a community SDK that I can probably use to write the Chip-8 graphics to. I haven&rsquo;t written a lot of Python recently either, so perhaps I&rsquo;ll look into making this as a learning project.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also going to be rewriting my website (yes, again), so please forgive any strange bugs that may occur on this site as I try my best to get it a little more modern. I&rsquo;ll be writing a post about this. Hopefully. If I remember. I have a lot of post ideas, and I&rsquo;m trying to get a couple weeks of backlog before I go back to school, so time to write!</p>

<p>Funnily enough this was my first time actually burning a USB (besides Raspberry Pi but that doesn&rsquo;t really count) - my prior Linux experience was just messing around in VMs hoping for things to not break. <a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>Life pro tip, when googling around the Manjaro forum, the links aren&rsquo;t broken, just add <code>archived.</code> in front of the forum link. This would have saved a lot of time for me. <em>sigh</em>. <a href="#fnref:3" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>To be fair, most of this was just me being very surprised that Linux wasn&rsquo;t as difficult as I thought it was. Very interesting. <a href="#fnref:4" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>I swear, the Manjaro forum has everything. And if it doesn&rsquo;t, the Arch Wiki definitely does. Linux and open source debugging is now forever mapped with wiki browsing in my mind. <a href="#fnref:5" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
