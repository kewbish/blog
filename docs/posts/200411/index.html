        <div class="writing">
            <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been chatting with some of my GCI friends, and many (GCI is supposed to be an <em>open source</em> based competition, after all) seem to use some form of Linux as their daily driver.</p>
<p><em>Disclaimer: this article isn&rsquo;t intended to spark up the quintessential &lsquo;which distro is best&rsquo; question. Just my opinions and naïve questions.</em></p>
<p>We had a very engaging discussion about Arch Linux, along with all the <a href="https://kde.org/plasma-desktop">prettifying DEs</a> or whatever. I&rsquo;d been thinking about transferring to Linux for daily driver (O how intellectual I feel when I use that phrase) for a while now (ever since I started exploring OSS), so I began digging around for more details.</p>
<p>Yeah, <code>Windows bad Linux good</code> may be the most prevalent OS-view, but I&rsquo;ve found some little snags that are stopping me from converting to another Arch cult member.</p>
<p><em>Disclaimer #2: I haven&rsquo;t tested Linux on a dual boot on my laptop yet either, so things might work better than they seem. I have no clue - just looking for answers.</em></p>
<h2 id="battery-life">Battery life</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been having some battery problems (unrelated and just due to normal wear and tear of abusing a three year old laptop), so I thought I&rsquo;d look into how the battery life was for Linux (specifically Manjaro.) Unfortunately, I found a bunch of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ManjaroLinux/comments/cd25si/battery_life_in_manjaro_kde_is_atrocious_compared/">very annoyed Redditors</a> ranting about the atrocities of battery management.</p>
<p>According to my colleagues, they haven&rsquo;t noticed anything, but I&rsquo;m worried that battery life will significantly decrease with all the software that&rsquo;s not properly optimized for Linux (more about this later). I still need to go to school (and uni soon) and I don&rsquo;t want to have to wrangle a powercord around because my laptop won&rsquo;t last for six hours of light notetaking.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> I mean, I can definitely try loading up Arch, and downloading tlp / powertop / checking whatever, but not sure if I want to invest in testing when my dearest Windows setup still works.</p>
<h2 id="chrome-or-firefox">Chrome or Firefox?</h2>
<p>Firefox has been touted around as a nice, fast, open browser, but yes - I&rsquo;m a heretic who still uses Chrome. Sue me.<br>
As such, I&rsquo;d like to still end up using Chrome, but after looking into <a href="https://www.linuxuprising.com/2018/08/how-to-enable-hardware-accelerated.html">the high CPU usage issues</a>, I&rsquo;m not sure how feasible that would be. Again, battery life &gt; performance (at least while I&rsquo;m doing light work) for me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d not have a user-ex problem with switching to FireFox - the UI looks similar enough to Chrome, and the features are the same, if not better. Through a quick Google search, I found <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1184924">some cursory information on getting the Chrome aesthetics back</a>.</p>
<p>I have no bookmarks or much other information to migrate, and for passwords and things there seems to be a painless migration progress.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m actually really happy that the extension ecosystem is rather similar; I can get my <a href="https://darkreader.org/">DarkReader</a>, <a href="https://getadblock.com/">Adblock</a>, and other smol things. (Side note: there&rsquo;s a great <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/audio-only-youtube/pkocpiliahoaohbolmkelakpiphnllog?hl=en">audio-only YouTube</a> that only allows the audio through. I like it - I usually listen in the background and don&rsquo;t watch 100% focused in anyway.)</p>
<p>The main gripe I have with FireFox is the apparent high CPU and RAM as well. I&rsquo;ve heard this goes away if you can tonnes of tabs open, but I&rsquo;m a minimal-as-few-tabs-as-possible type of browser user. If I do go down the Linux rabbit hole, I&rsquo;ll have to weigh both of them, and check CPU / RAM by hand myself. I&rsquo;m not quite sure about the performance - and I&rsquo;m also used to Chrome.<br>
<strong>Solution: Not a major problem, I guess. Whatever&rsquo;s smoother.</strong></p>
<h2 id="file-system">File system</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be dual booting if I do go into the Linux world (just for a little <em>Transition</em> period), so it&rsquo;d be nice to be able to access Windows and Linux files from whatever OS I&rsquo;ve booted into.<br>
<strong>Solution: Mount partitions, which should allow read/write between filesystems. I haven&rsquo;t done much research on this, but theoretically, according to my cursory searches, it should be fine.</strong></p>
<h2 id="note-taking">Note taking</h2>
<p>I have a single notebook in Onenote, but inside, there&rsquo;s a gargantuan mess of tabs and pages and notes and whatever else my mind decides to spew out.</p>
<p>I really like the system, but even with Wine, the UWP won&rsquo;t work (<em>obviously</em>) and the 2016 version doesn&rsquo;t seem to have good support either (<code>Garbage</code> rating). Therefore, if I switch, I&rsquo;m probably also going to have to switch notetaking systems.</p>
<p>Right now, I actually write all my assignments and take my digital notes inside Onenote (I&rsquo;m a <em>quirky</em> user) and format everything in Word later. I&rsquo;d love to have some Latex support, and have it sync to the cloud, but the main things are dark mode, markdown or at least some sort of plaintext formatting, and a decent UI.<br>
<a href="https://evernote.com/">Evernote</a> is the go-to, and while it seems like it checks all the boxes, I also don&rsquo;t like that I&rsquo;ll have to pay eventually.</p>
<p><a href="https://notion.so">Notion</a> has been promoted a lot recently by productivity YouTubers, and personally, I really like this system. It&rsquo;s clean, and it&rsquo;s simple. However, as with Evernote, the powerful tools that I&rsquo;d really need are locked behind a paywall. And I know I can get a Student plan, but what happens when I&rsquo;m no longer a student? <code>:cash-register-opens:</code></p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://joplinapp.org/">Joplin</a>. The UI isn&rsquo;t nearly as pretty, but their system will play nicely with what I need. As well, it has an iOS app (aiya I&rsquo;m switching to Android later alright) for now, which is a nice bonus. And open sourced and GitHubized as well! It seems like what I need, but I&rsquo;m still going to be looking around for prettier solutions, like <a href="https://notable.md">Notable</a>, another solution that&rsquo;s a lot prettier but doesn&rsquo;t have an app. I can, however, get Onedrive, so that might be good for my notetaking.</p>
<p>(Quick edit: <a href="https://boostnote.io/">Boostnote</a> also seems super cool - I like the UI, and it should support sync. Mobile apps too. But again - a little bit of a paid tier.)
<strong>Solution: we&rsquo;ll figure it out later.</strong></p>
<h2 id="ms-office-replacement">MS Office Replacement</h2>
<p>I love Word. I&rsquo;m a PowerPoint animation master. I&rsquo;m learning Excel, and in the meantime, forcing it to generate my lab graphs.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;ll be hard to think about moving away. I know OSS is superior yada yada yada, but the UI of all these programs is just so <em>integrated</em> and <em>shiny</em>.</p>
<p>Out of <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/">LibreOffice</a>, <a href="https://www.freeoffice.com/en/">FreeOffice</a>, and individual replacement programs: I&rsquo;d probably go with LibreOffice. Widely used, and a big community. As well, it has dark mode for most of its apps, and also introduces a nice Math editor - which will be very useful in the future.<br>
It&rsquo;s also decently integrated with importing and exporting MS files, which you can see is a recurring theme in this: compatibility or easy migration from what I have now. I really don’t to rewrite, archive, or throw away all my past work - and with most of LibreOffice, I won&rsquo;t have to.</p>
<p>It does look a little outdated though in many of its screenshots. FreeOffice does a better job here, but I&rsquo;m not sure if FreeOffice has the power that LibreOffice does.<br>
<strong>Solution: LibreOffice is good enough.</strong></p>
<h2 id="other">Other</h2>
<p>I also use GitHub Desktop, <a href="https://telegram.org">Telegram</a>, <a href="https://blender.org">Blender</a>, <a href="https://unity.com">sometimes Unity</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/">rarely, Steam</a>, <a href="https://www.spotify.com/ca-en/download/linux/">Spotify</a>, and <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VSCode</a>, but these all have easily-integrated Linux versions. Won&rsquo;t have switch, and honestly, don&rsquo;t want to, anytime soon.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure how useful a dual boot will be. If I switch, cold-turkey, it&rsquo;ll actually force me to learn and use a new system, and I won&rsquo;t be able to chicken out and default back. However, if I don&rsquo;t keep a dual-boot of Windows, I also risk having to last-minute edit whatever Windows-based things (though I think I&rsquo;ve looked into enough equivalent versions of software I frequently use).</p>
<p>Over the summer, I&rsquo;ll definitely continue looking into complete alternatives and try to wrap my head around Linux-ifying my workflows. And hey, if I consider it a good option - I&rsquo;ll do it.</p>
<h2 id="currently">Currently</h2>
<p>You might see that a lot of my activity for the next bit will be in private repositories. I&rsquo;m not working on a secret project - just an interactive HTML tutorial that&rsquo;ll teach a user to create a resume. It&rsquo;ll probably be closed source, but we&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been working with <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue</a> for about two weeks now, and I think it&rsquo;s a great framework. The CLI forcing the node_modules is a little annoying, but otherwise, no Vue complaints. I haven&rsquo;t seriously worked with Javascript much, but transitioning from Python isn&rsquo;t too much of a hassle. I don&rsquo;t really like the system of having a huge node folder - I prefer just importing and having a smaller script, but that&rsquo;s just me.</p>
<p>Quarantine&rsquo;s been great for learning - hope y&rsquo;all are staying safe, having fun (but not too much), and washing your hands (or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if you can find it).</p>
