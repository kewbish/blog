<p>A few months ago, I applied for an internship somewhere. It was a pretty standard application for a pretty standard development position. List your specialties, why you wish to apply, what makes you a good candidate. Have a 250 word input to cram your life&rsquo;s goals and achievements. Upload your resume, mindlessly fill demographic information, do you wish to forward a copy of your responses to your email, click send. A cookie-cutter application, nothing special.</p>
<p>One of the main parts of the application was to upload a major project, and write a little bit about it. They&rsquo;d consider the size, purpose, application, and several other characteristics of the given code sample, apparently, and this was a key point of evaluation for the position. What I submitted is irrelevant to the point, but I remember submitting the application with a worrying thought in the back of my mind.</p>
<p>As I was going through past participant&rsquo;s blog posts and collecting any shreds of insider information, I realized that there was a clear divide between &rsquo;their projects&rsquo;, and &lsquo;my projects&rsquo;. Theirs were so much more complex, integrating many technologies, and actually had an obvious industry or consumer application. My science fair project<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> - certainly not &lsquo;clean code&rsquo; by any regards - seemed very small in comparison.</p>
<p>Through this application, I realized that I really didn&rsquo;t have any &lsquo;big&rsquo; projects. My largest project was not my most complex, or anything that&rsquo;d I&rsquo;d deem representative of my skill. My more &lsquo;complicated&rsquo; projects were more components to be mishmashed to extend or work with other software, not individual applications.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking about my work recently over the New Year, and I&rsquo;ve come to conclusion that I&rsquo;ve preferred to write small tools for myself. No one else (well, okay, maybe <em>very</em> small amounts of people) will probably use them, and that&rsquo;s okay for now. I&rsquo;d eventually like to work on bigger projects, but I&rsquo;d also like to make sure that those projects are something I&rsquo;m personally invested in, and not something I&rsquo;m developing for the sake of my resume or something. At the moment, I haven&rsquo;t found an idea or something that I&rsquo;d want to work on - plus, senior year and the associated heavy workload.</p>
<p>However, I still think there&rsquo;s an interesting area to be explored with &lsquo;small software&rsquo;. In this post, I&rsquo;d like to highlight two (and a half) toolkits I&rsquo;ve used to make the aforementioned personalized software. Consider this a combination of thoughts regarding making extremely customized software for a small user base, and a year (± three years) in review.</p>
<h2 id="prelude---roblox">Prelude - Roblox</h2>
<p>Roblox has been described as both a highly addicting platform, and a highly creative engine. (If you don&rsquo;t know what Roblox is, go look it up - the development and monetization side of things is especially interesting.) I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve seen a community that&rsquo;s been more inspired to share games (barring perhaps Minecraft, which shares similar traits). Even though I was maybe ten, I still managed to wrangle a couple small obbies (essentially 3D platformers) and story adventures out. The Roblox community, as I remember it, was a hivemind of kids teaching other kids how to program. I&rsquo;m sure that there were a good chunk of competent adult programmers, but as a kid (maybe it was just selection bias), I remember looking up to those channels churning out Lua tutorials each week.</p>
<p>Roblox was my &lsquo;in&rsquo; to game development. It&rsquo;s nowhere as complicated as Unity, and it&rsquo;s a great example of something that&rsquo;s literally child-proof yet has an ample system for expansion. I had no experience with proper programming or game design, yet the system of prefabricated assets and drag-and-drop configurability made it super easy to get started. Lua was too complicated for me to understand, but with assets, I managed to bodge together a CTF game for me and my classmates. It was only for us, and was, looking back at the previews I can see on the Roblox site, absolutely horrible. It was just a tiny map with several biomes and &lsquo;hidden&rsquo; flags (the concept of randomization and terrain generation was still several years to come) - but it was something. Something that I&rsquo;d made, and proudly showed off, climbing up several rungs in the 5th-grade social hierarchy as <em>the</em> Roblox dev.</p>
<p>While Roblox is a proper standalone platform, I included it here because it has a sort of whimsy that I find mirrored in the other two (eco)systems that I want to touch on today. That first spark of ownership is something that&rsquo;s sort of addicting to the right people, and probably a good explanation to the infinite server forks my friends had. Roblox gave budding devs a platform, and held their hand until they stepped into the infinite world of Lua and &lsquo;proper&rsquo; scripting. I think that&rsquo;s kind of fun - not just because it&rsquo;s so easy to use, but also because it actually makes game development open, and encourages little kids towards creation, and little bit away from mindless consumption<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<h2 id="chrome-extensions">Chrome Extensions</h2>
<p>An interesting approach to building hyperpersonalized tools is by extending yet another tool. One of the best examples of this is browser extensions - what better to customize than the very tool you&rsquo;re spending most of your online life in? I already use my browser to consume most of my content, and to keep in touch with people, so I personally think investing some time into making the browser exactly what I&rsquo;d like it to be is a worthwhile investment.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a developer, or have any experience with JS, Chrome extensions are relatively easy to get started with - a manifest.json and a couple small HTML / JS files later, and you&rsquo;ve got a working extension. Because they&rsquo;re so easy to use, they&rsquo;re what I generally turn to in order to facilitate and automate basic actions that I do often. I&rsquo;ve made ones recently for <a href="https://github.com/kewbish/revshare-gh">Revshare for GH</a>, and one that I&rsquo;m using at the moment for tracking some interesting experimental data (blog postmortem of self-research to come in a couple weeks). Both took relatively short times to build - one was a CS50 project, which took a month-ish, and one was done in literally an hour. The difference? Whether I chose to make it a &lsquo;proper project&rsquo; - more on this later.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something very fun in playing with and manipulating what&rsquo;s shown on a page, especially when it&rsquo;s something just you&rsquo;ll use.With the way Chrome makes it relatively easy to add and iterate on your own extensions by loading unpacked folders somewhere, I can justify taking a couple hours to slap something together to fix a &lsquo;minor problem&rsquo;. Of course, there&rsquo;ll be &lsquo;minor problems&rsquo; that a lot of people share, or that you&rsquo;d like to make aware to others - this is when publishing an extension might come in handy. But for the majority of my &lsquo;minor problems&rsquo;, it seems that no one else has them, so for now, I&rsquo;m content to continue hacking away with &lsquo;hyperpersonalized&rsquo; things.</p>
<h2 id="shortcuts">Shortcuts</h2>
<p>Shortcuts (on iOS, though I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;ll be an Android equivalent <em>somewhere</em>) is another example of extending an ecosystem to personalize it. As with Chrome extensions, people have made amazing things - I&rsquo;ve seen <a href="https://www.jacksondame.com/vestigory/get-started">entire life management and tracker apps</a> made in it, as well as very slick widget apps and integrations<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. It&rsquo;s sort of like a hybrid automation and Siri extension system, but I use it mainly for its automation capabilities and integrations. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll ever get into iOS development, but Shortcuts lets me make what is essentially a proper app - I can enable it in the Share Sheet (the little popup when you&rsquo;d like to share something) and I can make it do rather complicated things with APIs and files. It&rsquo;s an interesting attempt by Apple to finally give people some much-appreciated customization and a way to make apps without shelling out for a license and diving into learning Swift.</p>
<p>Using the right tool for the right job is something that I often ignore, but I&rsquo;ve recently been trying to decomplicate most of the things I make (which, historically, have been very overcomplicated). A couple weeks ago, I was trying to make a little form for a tracker, and was toying with the idea of making a PWA of some sort, connecting it to some GitHub repository issue<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. In short, it would be very complicated, but good fun to code. However, I resisted the urge to immediately go create a new repo - I&rsquo;d rediscovered Shortcuts earlier that week. It was surprisingly pain-free to drag and drop a bunch of blocks together to POST data to a Google Sheet (probably a better way of storing information as opposed to an issue thread), as well as make it available to interact with from the browser bar.</p>
<p>Another interesting thing with Shortcuts is that it&rsquo;s the very embodiment of the entire &rsquo;no-code&rsquo; thing that&rsquo;s supposed to become popular enough to take over my job right about when I graduate university (/s. Maybe.). I don&rsquo;t have a lot of Shortcuts rigged up at the moment, but I&rsquo;d agree with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/shortcuts/">r/Shortcuts</a> that the entire process of making one is very <em>satisfying</em>. Sometimes the smaller screen size of my phone makes it a bit difficult to drag things to the right places, and sometimes copy-pasting things around can be a hassle. Still, I think there&rsquo;s a sort of whimsy in building your own &lsquo;app&rsquo; that even non-technical people can take advantage of. Again, there&rsquo;s that hyperpersonalization people can get. Instead of waiting for someone to solve your problems for you with a proper app, you can slap something else together in Shortcuts.</p>
<h2 id="honourable-mention-replit">Honourable Mention: Repl.it</h2>
<p><a href="https://repl.it/">Repl.it</a> also ties in quite nicely to my points about Shortcuts: what these two tools have in common is their excellent method of reducing the boilerplate and meta-work involved in creating something. I remember when I first started getting into Python, I was still on Windows (with its very scuffed language download methods and its <a href="https://superuser.com/questions/1437590/typing-python-on-windows-10-version-1903-command-prompt-opens-microsoft-stor">automatic symlink to the Windows Store</a>), and I&rsquo;d only been introduced back then to either VSCode or proprietary web IDEs. In short, I had no idea how to install Python. But Repl.it let me set up my little scripts and later, even full-on shared Discord bots, without having to mess with the tooling. There&rsquo;s a very magical sort of excitement that comes from being able to spin up my own machine and focus on the development - sure, it feels less official than doing the Heroku or Docker deployment yourself, but, as with Shortcuts, it&rsquo;s abstracting away the pain points, and letting users focus on the process of creation instead. (And unlike other IDE solutions, it&rsquo;s powerful too - not just a sanitized input system that strips out XSS or whatever.) When trying to work with hyperpersonalized software, I don&rsquo;t want to have to deal with devops tooling - I can let things be slightly messy and unconventional, as long as they&rsquo;re taking away the pain of setting up deployment.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Returning to the internship application: my GitHub has a significant population of these tiny creations - be it extensions, small scripts, and personal utilities. Microapps, as I&rsquo;ve decided to call these small little one-user extensions and automations, are something that I&rsquo;d like to continue to explore. I keep returning to the word whimsy to describe these microapps, and that&rsquo;s because whimsicalness is exactly what I see in making these. The ease of iteration and production is sort of a fascinating idea, and one that I&rsquo;ll always keep an eye out for. I realize there&rsquo;s something sort of ironic in actively sharing microapps, but hey - maybe I&rsquo;ll help one person who has the very specific problem that I do, and that&rsquo;s more than enough.</p>
<p>By taking the pressure off to make something that&rsquo;s useful for other people, or that&rsquo;s polished enough that you&rsquo;d be willing to shamelessly promote it everywhere, I feel like I have the freedom to focus on having ideas that&rsquo;d benefit me first. I&rsquo;d have that freedom anyway, but by plastering &rsquo;this is hyperpersonalized, don&rsquo;t attack me if it&rsquo;s broken in one of these edge cases&rsquo; over the project mentally, it feels like I have more room to figure things out. While I&rsquo;m happy to, and do, share most of my work, I&rsquo;d rather not add more stress to maintain something I don&rsquo;t believe in anymore, or that I&rsquo;m forcing myself to do for no good reason.</p>
<p>I think this can serve as an effective sieve of ideas - a bunch of ideas flow in, and you filter them in or out depending on whether you yourself are emotionally drawn to the idea. Ideally, you&rsquo;d find a happy medium of &lsquo;helps people&rsquo; and &lsquo;helps me&rsquo;, but that might not be the case all the time. I&rsquo;m still very young - I have a vague idea of what I&rsquo;d like to do, and what I&rsquo;d like to work on in the meantime to get myself to that end direction. For now, I&rsquo;m leaning on the side of &lsquo;helps me&rsquo; - there&rsquo;s something very satisfactory in building smaller tools that benefit my own workflow.</p>

<p>I also find it really amazing that Roblox actually has a system to properly pay their developers. I&rsquo;m pretty sure if I&rsquo;d known as a kid that I could have saved up a couple Robux, I&rsquo;d have put much more time and effort into trying to monetize my hobby - I was a very entrepreneurial type of kid. I remember seeing <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/23/college-student-video-game-creator-made-millions-from-jailbreak.html">an article (might have been this one)</a> about the creators of Jailbreak, a game I&rsquo;m pretty sure all my classmates were fairly addicted to. (I wasn&rsquo;t good enough at the game, and stuck to obbies, but those are in themselves extremely lucrative.) You&rsquo;d expect most people would&rsquo;t pay for cosmetics, but I suppose the in-game (and in-class) clout people who had Roblox Premium or whatever was enough of an incentive.&#160;<a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>Somewhat ironically, I still haven&rsquo;t bothered to customize my home screen.
