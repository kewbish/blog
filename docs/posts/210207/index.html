            <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking more about the things I read: content, perspective, and contribution to my being in some form. As of now, content-wise, I prefer a mix of technology and meta-productivity or knowledge-building. Perspective-wise, I don&rsquo;t really have an opinion on, but seeing things from very passionate and very noncommital points of view can be interesting. Recently, I&rsquo;ve been mostly focusing on thinking about how what I read fits in, contribution-wise.</p>
<p>This series of thoughts started with me doing a decent chunk of self-study of maths, physics, and some CS over the summer. I was reading a lot of drier information each day, but most of it was material I needed to cover (well, not needed, but wanted to, for the sake of pre-reading) and properly remember. Trying to take clear and concise notes to build a library of references I could look back to later was not the most innovative or impactful summer project, but at least it helped me build a sense of what I liked in content, and what role I wanted consuming that information to play in my daily life.</p>
<p>While trying to teach myself, I started to notice that there were certain information &lsquo;aesthetics&rsquo; that I tended towards. I have a thing both for older, pre-&lsquo;CSS is important&rsquo; era university sites, where math profs simply share their knowledge without any ulterior motive; and newer sites that perhaps contained interactives, or more casual information sharing. My article aesthetic now is similar - I tend towards indie personal sites, rather than &lsquo;popular&rsquo; blogs with share buttons plastered all over. However, finding those articles and websites is pretty difficult - how do I search for &lsquo;small blogs that write generally about programming but in a easy-to-understand way&rsquo;?</p>
<p><a href="https://findka.com">Findka</a>, so far, has been eerily good at recommending things that I&rsquo;m actually interested in - I suppose the closer and more active user base has something to do with that<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Despite not having the popularity of other forums like r/programming and dev.to, it strikes a nice balance of articles both aligning with and outside my interests. It&rsquo;s become much easier to find a couple articles to read a day to satisfy my productive procrastination needs, rather than having to scroll through other sites with a much higher noise to signal ratio.</p>
<p>However, I still found that I was trying to skim through a bit too much each day. I was still alt-tabbing to go off on blog post tangents when I&rsquo;d set out to do something completely different, and I wanted to try to curtail that as much as possible. With the new year, and all the vague self-improvement energy that saturates the internet, I decided to track every article I read for the month of January (spoiler: I have somehow trained myself to subconsciously continue this, well into February). I was looking to see what insights I could gain, and observe if consciously tracking content would make a difference in what and why I was reading.</p>
<h2 id="the-rules">The Rules</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ll go into how I tracked and counted these articles exactly in a bit, but I&rsquo;d like to explain my materials and methods first. (I will try my best not to turn this into a giant lab report, but as I edit this, I can see that I&rsquo;ve somewhat failed.) I imposed a couple of rules on what counted as an article to track or not, mainly to keep statistics more consistent.</p>
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;d keep forum-like sites out of the article count - things like Reddit, Lobste.rs discussions, Twitter threads and StackOverflow pages wouldn&rsquo;t count.</li>
<li>Speaking of StackOverflow, tutorials and other technical references also weren&rsquo;t included. Documentation for libraries, looking up regex, or following some walkthrough to set something up, for example, fall into this category.</li>
<li>Content required for schoolwork was not included as well - the point of this experiment was to track what I was reading outside of school, not how much I was studying.</li>
<li>I allowed myself to skim the first paragraph-ish to determine if I&rsquo;d like to read the article fully or not, and then track the article. I was definitely also allowed to stop reading the post at any time, but by any point after the first hundred-ish words, the article would already be tracked.</li>
<li>Every single article besides that would be counted - blog posts, Reddit and Twitter links, Findka recommendations would all count towards the day&rsquo;s total.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-graphs">The Graphs</h2>
<p>So we&rsquo;ve come to the graphs, of which there are only two - I think they encapsulate most of the data well enough, and leaves out the parts that I&rsquo;d rather not share (for example, the list of posts I read). One shows a total of articles read per day, with a three day rolling average, and the other shows a distribution of the times I read any article each day.</p>
<figure>

            <p><em>Figure 1. Articles read per day.</em></p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>You can see a large spike in the beginning of the experiment - I&rsquo;ve coloured those bars a darker grey because I don&rsquo;t think they represent what I was actually reading. If I go back through the Google Sheet (more about technical implementations later) that houses all my responses, there&rsquo;s a lot of repeated links clustered very close together, so I&rsquo;m going to assume I was trying to figure out how to make the technical bits and pieces work together.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a pretty significant dip in the middle of the experiment - it was already coming to the end of term, and there was a steady influx of homework, leaving less time for reading. It&rsquo;s interesting to see how homework has such a significant impact on what I can consume content-wise, but that&rsquo;s sort of expected anyhow.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d also like to mention that I went from 5 Findka articles a day, to 3, somewhere in that second week, which ended up increasing back to 4 in the third. I&rsquo;ve been increasingly turning to Matter and Findka (on Matter, yay RSS feeds!) more instead of scrolling through aggregators, so a fluctuation in articles there generally correlates with changes in reading.</p>

        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This figure shows the timestamps of each log. There are two main bands around morning and afternoon - more on that later.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like some raw numbers:</p>
<ul>
<li>I read 174 articles over 26 days - short and long form are included</li>
<li>That averages to around 6.69 articles a day over the entire range</li>
<li>Each week, I averaged a different number of articles:
<ul>
<li>The first week (I was doing a lot of testing with my Shortcuts and things), I averaged 9.5 per day</li>
<li>The second week, I averaged 4.6 articles a day</li>
<li>The third week, I averaged 4.4 articles per day</li>
<li>For the last week of the experiment, I averaged 5.5 a day</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-findings">The Findings</h2>
<p>I suppose that this would be the discussion part of this pseudo-lab report, so let&rsquo;s get into some expectations, findings and takeaways.</p>
<p>My hypothesis going into this entire tracking experiment was that by being more conscious about what and when I was reading, I&rsquo;d manage to self-regulate more impulsive reading sprees, and check the productive procrastination that sometimes ticks in. Before I started this, I had a bit of a reflex to just Ctrl-T, open up a new tab, and sort of spam whatever into the omnibox before my brain consciously processed what I was doing, and then close the tab. (Oddly enough, I ended up not going down those rabbit holes most of the time anyway, but it was a bit annoying to accidentally keep opening and searching around for things to procrastinate with.)</p>
<p>In the rules, I explicitly stated that I wouldn&rsquo;t include Reddit, Twitter, or discussion threads in the totals for each day. I thought that this would lead me to spend proportionally more time there, but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s made a significant difference. I think that having to explicitly log what I was reading while giving myself planned time to read reduced the urge to go look for something to read well enough. At the moment, I go through my Findka, Matter, and Nitter in the morning, and I&rsquo;ve realized that there&rsquo;s really no point in checking much more frequently - people don&rsquo;t create meaningful content in 15 minute intervals. It feels more satisfying to go through a larger chunk of content anyways, though I can&rsquo;t measure how much of this was due to the tracking in any quantifiable numbers. Creating a regular schedule for reading through things, and trying to keep myself accountable with the log, was surprisingly useful.</p>
<p>Speaking of surprises, tracking every single link I&rsquo;d read over the past month has built up sort of a library effect. While retention of points isn&rsquo;t something I&rsquo;ve explored in my data at all, I have less of an issue finding really great articles and then losing them in my browser history. I know that everything I&rsquo;ve read is in a central location, and it&rsquo;s much easier to find things in one place than to search for that place, and then for the article I&rsquo;m looking for<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. (It&rsquo;s also probably useful to mention that I do generate summaries of what I&rsquo;ve read each week to review and see what I&rsquo;d like to take away from.) I find that I can at least vaguely remember what I&rsquo;ve read better - especially since I try to consciously choose better articles to &lsquo;commit&rsquo; to when I track them.</p>
<p>Going back to the raw data, and the charts I put in the section above, it&rsquo;s interesting to see how the amount of schoolwork (a non-tracked item, but something I can very clearly remember) has an impact on my reading. It&rsquo;s probably just because of how I organize my days - if I really have homework to catch up on, I&rsquo;ll work in the time that I have scheduled out for checking various social media, which pushes the reading to the next available block of time (which, if I&rsquo;m busy, would be in a while). It&rsquo;s also interesting to see that, even with heavy workloads, I kept up with most of my recommendations and reading, never going a day without reading at least something. I think it&rsquo;s valuable to set aside time to see what others have written about, so that&rsquo;s a habit I think I&rsquo;d like to continue.</p>
<p>If I scan the time logged for each article logged, I can see two main blocks - morning and night. (Disregarding the first couple days - those longer series are probably from when I was testing out my system.) It&rsquo;s interesting that I read very consistently at night, and a bit less, though still very consistently, in the mornings. (Let&rsquo;s pretend the ones in the middle are me during breaks and not me █████ █████████████ in █████.)</p>
<p>I have no other data to check my totals against (I can&rsquo;t exactly just search up blog post total articles spent), so I also have absolutely no idea how my consumption compares to the average population. Maybe I spend a lot more time compared to other people, maybe I don&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;d be interested to see how others perform this experiment and how it changes their views, but it&rsquo;s also not a data comparison I&rsquo;m entirely that interested in.</p>
<p>In terms of sources of error (always a fun section to write in labs), I can&rsquo;t think of much besides a) not balancing for word counts and b) mixing the testing / development data in with the actual end data. I don&rsquo;t think it makes too much of a difference for point a if you consider ideas absorbed instead of purely articles read, or their length. In terms of point b, I think it&rsquo;s fine to just ignore days 6 through 8, and pretend I started the entire experiment a little later.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>There was an interesting article <a href="https://junglegym.substack.com/p/the-t-shaped-information-diet">about the T-shaped approach to content</a> that I read recently, which discusses the types of information that you choose to consume. That was something I tried to keep in mind throughout the experiment, and I think that, considering my findings and my managing to train myself not to unconsciously alt-tab away to be unproductive when I work, the experiment can be considered a success.</p>
<p>In lab reports, this is the part where I try to convince you how relevant this research is, and how it can be applied. In terms of relevance and application, there&rsquo;s not much else besides being a bit more aware of what content you consume. That, and keeping extremely detailed data on your reading habits, which might appeal to some. I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend this to someone, nor would I advise against it - it&rsquo;s pretty fun to do, and an interesting dataset to analyze later.</p>
<p>In the future, I might like to look at how I use forum sites instead: an area that I specifically left out of this post. That, combined with more productivity-oriented research, might be an interesting area of self-experimentation. I can&rsquo;t figure out a way to analyze the subject matter or word count of each post, but I&rsquo;m pretty happy with the data I&rsquo;ve managed to collect so far. I&rsquo;m still continuing this experiment - I&rsquo;ll probably continue to track everything this year. Because of how I designed the Chrome extension and the Shortcut (see appendix A for other relevant technical magic), the friction of adding a new article is close to none, meaning I&rsquo;ll be more likely to continue using it anyway. It&rsquo;s become a new reflex anyway, and I think having this big of a dataset to analyze maybe later in the year will provide additional interesting insights.</p>
<h2 id="appendix-a-technical-digressions">Appendix A: Technical Digressions</h2>
<p>This is the part that fellow nerds might find mildly interesting, but that you should feel free to skip. Some of the work I did with the tracking inspired the <a href="https://kewbi.sh/blog/posts/210124/">hyperpersonalization</a> post I wrote earlier, while I was continuing this experiment on my own. I&rsquo;ll try to briefly explain how everything gets logged, and leave some trails for interested parties to follow up on.</p>
<p>I knew right off the bat that I wanted the process of logging to be as simple as possible - that meant a maximum of one click away on my laptop, and from the share sheet on my phone. Instead of trying to rig up some complicated API and spin up a Heroku server, I decided to go a simpler route: a simple Google Form, linked directly to a Google Sheet. The form has a field for the URL of the post and notes (I didn&rsquo;t end up writing notes as I read, but rather later at the end of my week during my review), and automatically fills in the exact time the form was submitted.</p>
<p>However, I obviously wouldn&rsquo;t <em>fill in a form manually</em> - we have automation to overengineer! Google Forms have a great link function, where you can autofill and submit a form from just a link. From the form link, something like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/{id}/viewform/
</code></pre></div><p>you can get to something like</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/{id}/formResponse?usp=pp_url&amp;{key}={val}&amp;{key}={val}&amp;submit=Submit
</code></pre></div><p>You can get this from getting a prefilled link within Google Forms itself.</p>
<p>I managed to bodge together a Chrome extension with this fetch (and a couple lines to display a badge), which I then bound to a keyboard shortcut. I also slapped this fetch into a iOS Shortcut by enabling share sheet for the shortcut, and getting the URL from the input to put into a &lsquo;Get Contents of URL&rsquo; block. I can then log articles from my phone and my laptop super easily, which was a major reason the experiment went so well. I expect there&rsquo;s a similar shortcut-maker for Android, but iOS Shortcuts feel so snappy to make. You might also want to reference <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/shortcuts/comments/bp735g/how_to_add_rows_to_google_sheets_from_a_shortcut/">this brilliant guide</a>, and adapt it for whatever platform you&rsquo;re planning to track on.</p>
<p>I then wrote a simple Python script to persist a &lsquo;row last read&rsquo; count of the Sheet in a file, and parsed the CSV values since the last pull with <code>csv</code> and <code>requests</code>. That all gets sent into a Markdown file for me to process and read through at the end of the week. I can also download a full CSV file to process the data in an external app directly from Sheets.</p>
<p>None of the above is open source at the moment, but I trust the guide and the Internet can get you to what I&rsquo;ve managed to do in much shorter time than it took me to even try to figure out how to do it.</p>
<p>In terms of <a href="#the-graphs">the graphs</a>, those were generated with a little bit of pivot table magic in LibreOffice Calc. The first required a little bit of summing each day together, and the other required just inserting a normal chart and editing the major gridlines to fit with the whole times-as-fractions that LO does. It took much more time than I&rsquo;m willing to admit, but all in the name of science, right?</p>
