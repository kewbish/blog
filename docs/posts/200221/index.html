<p>Recently, I began a new blog, hosted on GitHub Pages over <a href="http://kewbish.github.io/blog">here</a>. In the past, I&rsquo;ve tried (and eventually failed) to set up a devlog section on my site, and one of the main pain points was the repetitiveness of creating and pushing content. I had a template with very bare-bones HTML and CSS that I copied and pasted my work into, but this was annoying to constantly try to move my plaintext into rich HTML content. I ended up destroying the repo because it just became a burden to write for and maintain content for, which turned me off blogging or creating any internet content, basically, for about a year. However, with my <a href="https://kewbish.github.io/blog/posts/200214/">recent GCI win</a>, I felt that I needed to step up my digital presence and start devlogging for real.</p>
<h2 id="looking-for-a-ssg">Looking for a SSG</h2>
<p>Firmly entrenched in the idea of starting a blog and <a href="https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public/">publicly learning</a>, I began searching for some sort of generation tool.</p>
<p>Briefly, I considered biting the bullet and starting a <a href="https://wordpress.com">Wordpress</a> site. However, after a couple seconds of reconsidering (goddammit Kewbish, do you really want to do this?), I immediately discarded the idea. Having worked with Wordpress (and <a href="https://lienotly.weebly.com">Weebly, if anyone cares</a>), I knew how boring creating a site there would be, especially without the ability to fine-tune files and configure my site exactly as I liked it. As well, it would add a lot of bloat and annoyance to initial setup. Besides, then I&rsquo;d have to deal with another subdomain - (shut up, I&rsquo;ll get a domain soon).</p>
<p>Platforms like <a href="https://medium.com">Medium</a> and <a href="https://dev.to">Dev.to</a> allow an easy startup, but it wouldn&rsquo;t allow me to change much styling, and I&rsquo;d either get stuck behind a paywall somewhere (Medium) or be limited quite a bit to a developer audience (Dev.to). These platforms would give me a great starting readerbase and starting point, though I guess my inner demon-angel wouldn&rsquo;t let me do anything less than sink a week into learning something new.</p>
<p>The logical next step for me was a SSG (<strong>S</strong>tatic <strong>S</strong>ite <strong>G</strong>enerator). I&rsquo;d heard of <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, and its integration with GitHub Pages made it attractive, but the startup of having to install Ruby, a language I&rsquo;d not used (and frankly, don&rsquo;t plan on using) made me reluctant.</p>
<p><a href="https://gatsbyjs.org">Gatsby</a> had a great community, and its clear documentation brought it up as a good choice. However, despite my experience with web development, I&rsquo;ve chosen to steer relatively far away from JS-based tools (and haven&rsquo;t touched Node at all yet. One of the items on my ever-growing to-do list.) Therefore, I felt I should keep looking.</p>
<h2 id="choosing-hugo">Choosing Hugo</h2>
<p>Enter <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a>. Hugo seemed like an amazing compromise: easy startup (though I&rsquo;d have to handcode a theme) and relatively low bloatage. (As well, the community around the tool and its frequent maintenance made it extremely attractive.)</p>

With Hugo in hand, I set up to create the blog of my dreams.</p>
<h2 id="site-setup">Site Setup</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m familiar with <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">Markdown</a>, so writing for Hugo&rsquo;s Markdown-based generator wasn&rsquo;t a challenge. In fact, the most difficult part of the whole setup was probably theme development.</p>
<p><strong>Theme Development</strong> - The prideful human I am, I couldn&rsquo;t just use a <em>premade theme</em> (<a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/">of which there are plenty, if you were wondering</a>). (Oh, the <em>horror</em>.)</p>
<p>I started off then with a basic theme, and created the Markdown first. Then, I began styling my site with some basic CSS. It&rsquo;s still pretty bare-bones, but I feel like it&rsquo;s good enough for my basic purposes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still pretty new to <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/">Go&rsquo;s Templating tools</a>, but the Hugo documentation more-or-less described most of the variables I needed, as well as linking to forum posts detailing some of the features I implemented. Again, the <a href="https://discourse.gohugo.io">community</a> is amazing, and super active.</p>
<p><strong>Deployment</strong> - <code>++</code> to Hugo for providing a commit script. I have a recreation <a href="https://github.com/kewbish/blog/blob/master/deploy-blog.cmd">here (ðŸ’€ no longer exists)</a> for their <code>gh-pages</code> deployment solution, for all y&rsquo;all Windows folks. Overall, this part&rsquo;s relatively easy to follow, as long as you&rsquo;re Terminal / Command Prompt savvy.</p>
<p>I would have liked some sort of inbuilt hugo command for this, but porting the bash script to batch wasn&rsquo;t difficult, and generally ended up fine. I definitely recommend familiarizing yourself with <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree">worktree</a> before attempting a GitHub Pages deploy.</p>
<h2 id="using-a-ssg">Using a SSG</h2>
<p>Having had both a handcoded blog and now this SSG site, I definitely prefer the workflow of the SSG. The ability to create custom themes brings the aesthetics to the level of a handcoded website, adding the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">DRY principle</a>. Simply creating and formatting a MD file is a lot easier to manage than copy-pasting a bunch of components from hand-made templates. Besides, Hugo allows <a href="https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/">partials</a> and other inbuilt templates-inside-templates, and <em>everything is customizable</em>.</p>
<p>The following are some common cons, and what I have to say.
- <strong>SSGs are difficult to learn.</strong> False, actually. If you&rsquo;ve some Markdown knowledge, and basic experience with HTMl / CSS (what you&rsquo;d need for a handcoded approach anyway), you can learn Hugo. Hugo, in fact, is packaged into a single binary, and doesn&rsquo;t require other installs, unlike some other SSGs.<br>
- <strong>Every time I deploy, I have to rebuild.</strong> This is true, but I find the Hugo workflow better than the handcoded approach, especially with automation scripts.<br>
- <strong>SSGs work with files, instead of a database.</strong> This is a minor pain point, and means that as my blog grows, I&rsquo;ll need to manage my files well, instead of just tucking them into a database somewhere. However, I argue that this leads you to think about file structure design before the issues build up, and construct a scalable system in the beginning.<br>
- <strong>No one&rsquo;s ever heard of SSGs besides technical people.</strong> Wordpress, for sure, is a major player in the non-handcoded-site industry, but I feel the powers of open source and community outweigh the market strategy. Anyways, if I can build the same thing, there&rsquo;s no point in switching if all else equal.<br>
- <strong>Team and user management is nonexistent.</strong> In the traditional sense, yes, there can&rsquo;t be <code>admin</code>s and <code>writer</code>s and whatevers as you do with Wordpress or Weebly. However, hosting on a platform like GitHub Pages opens up even more possibilities, giving you the tools to collaborate even more.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>My migration process (or initialization process) was relatively painless, and I prefer the workflow to that of a handcoded experience. Hugo provides a great, open source framework for blogging and deployment to GitHub Pages (major <code>++</code>), which is what I use anyway.</p>
<p>Stop by and check the <a href="https://kewbish.github.io/blog">blog</a> out, and if there are any errors anywhere, open an issue and let me know!</p>
<h2 id="currently">Currently</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve just finished <a href="https://g.co/gci">GCI</a>, and have the <a href="https://vdsf.sfiab.com">VDSF</a> soon, so I&rsquo;m speedrunning my project and polishing it up.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I&rsquo;m in a bit of a quandary on projects, but I think I&rsquo;m going to continue <a href="https://github.com/kewbish/opus">Opus</a>, a book tracking system I&rsquo;ll build based on what I need personally. For that project, I&rsquo;ll be using <a href="https://kivy.org">Kivy</a> to create an iOS app (don&rsquo;t worry, it&rsquo;ll be on Android too, but I won&rsquo;t release it on the Play Store).</p>
<p>Recently, I&rsquo;ve been thinking more about what I&rsquo;d like to specialize in - web development, Python, some combination of the two, or delve deeper into lower-level languages and technologies. For now, I&rsquo;ll continue with what I&rsquo;m familiar with, which happens to be web technologies, but I&rsquo;m seriously considering learning C++ or perhaps some sort of machine learning project. <a href="https://tensorflow.org">Tensorflow&rsquo;s</a> been on my list for ages as well.<br>
Just some thoughts.</p>
