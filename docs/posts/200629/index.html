            <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>For the past couple days, I&rsquo;ve been attempting to relearn Scratch, and getting familiar with the CS50 development environment and submission routines. I really like David Malan&rsquo;s teaching style, and the following will be an attempt to categorize all my learnings this first week.</p>
<p>And by the way, I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;ll be notes this week. I&rsquo;m not planning on becoming a Scratch guru anytime soon, so I didn&rsquo;t really see the point of making notes. And besides, this was supposed to be an introduction for non-technical beginners, and I would consider myself a technical beginner(?), so I kind of disregarded it.</p>
<h2 id="scratch">Scratch</h2>
<p>I think the first time I used Scratch was sometime quite recently, actually. I didn&rsquo;t learn to program with Scratch, or anything, so it&rsquo;s hard to get nostalgic for something you&rsquo;ve never really cared about. However, when I came back, I realized that Scratch is <em>really user friendly</em>. And it should be, right? It&rsquo;s made for kids to learn how to program, but it can also get really advanced, really fast.</p>
<p>Take the first few example programs - little snippets explaining how to make a sprite say something, or change a costume. You&rsquo;d think just snippets thrown together would make for an easy game, but it does take more than just a ten-block script to make a proper game. My game is absolutely terrible - <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/405376909/">here&rsquo;s a link</a>, if you&rsquo;d care to find out. (Please don&rsquo;t check it out, it&rsquo;s just a terrible clone of Piano Tiles that usually breaks about 4 rounds in. But then again, it&rsquo;s also approximately the average of the quality of Scratch games, I guess. And I <em>did</em> make it all from <em>scratch</em>.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>) But I like getting guided a little, and then figuring things out by myself. It&rsquo;s pretty fun!</p>
<p>You see my game, right? And then you see the absolute masterpieces that others have made. It&rsquo;s kind of crazy how good Scratch games can be, especially with custom blocks and all the functionality. It&rsquo;s probably a good competitor for Unity2D, at this point. I&rsquo;m only half-joking.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-learned">What I Learned</h2>
<p>I was pretty surprised that Scratch was so full-featured, and that I was able to get a project started so quickly. (To be honest, I kind of spedrun the problem set while listening to the lecture, so maybe that wasn&rsquo;t the best idea) Any bugs I found were really easy to look up on the forums, and whatever I wanted to implement, I found guides to on the interwebs.</p>
<p>Something kind of strange was that the lecture seemed to cover a bunch of slightly irrelevant information in the beginning. I wondered why we were covering RGB and binary, when I didn&rsquo;t find any use for it during the Scratch problem set, and even from what I&rsquo;ve seen, problem sets one and two. Kind of interesting, but I supposed they&rsquo;re considered the &lsquo;foundations of computer science&rsquo;.</p>
<p>While some of my esteemed classmates were a little confused with how the GitHub submission systems worked, I found the submission processes extremely fun! It was a little weird to have that one commit lingering around (I have a bit of a 4-commit-a-day streak going at the moment), and I&rsquo;m kind of confused as to why check50 uploads code first and <em>then</em> checks it, but I like it. It&rsquo;s easy to use, and focused on the command line.</p>
<p>I was also a little confused as to why we started just with Scratch - we&rsquo;re not going to use this information in the rest of the course really. I saw a couple &lsquo;translation&rsquo; images in the notes for problem set one, which I assume would be good for people to understand, but why would we start with Scratch to translate from? I thought we&rsquo;d start with Python, actually. Going from Python to C seems a little more intuitive, because Python would be a little easier to get started with, I suppose. Python&rsquo;s syntax is a little less verbose and strict, which would probably be easier to start with. I don&rsquo;t know - just my thoughts. (And also because I don&rsquo;t want to learn C scree)</p>
<h2 id="teaching-style">Teaching Style</h2>
<p>Malan&rsquo;s teaching style is incredibly fast-paced - and that&rsquo;s great! For now, at least, it&rsquo;s nice to be able to speedrun and cram information quickly. Now, I can still understand mostly how to make these programs (referencing week 1, at least). However, I&rsquo;ll see how it&rsquo;ll pan out in the future - will the speed be too much to handle?</p>
<p>As well, Malan&rsquo;s teaching is as clear as it is speedy. His examples (ripping a phone book - big dedication) really do stick in your brain. It&rsquo;s so memeable as well, mostly because of the very interesting examples. :binary_leds:</p>
<p>One of my favourite parts about CS50 is how the lectures are <em>mostly</em> transcribed into notes, and a text format. Text is easier for me to scan and learn from, and audio can be a little difficult to parse. The entire contents of the lecture is there, but I can read and understand it a lot faster. It&rsquo;s less tedious to just reread a couple paragraphs than rewinding video over and over again. I really appreciate whoever decided to do that - it&rsquo;s a lifesaver.</p>
<p>In addition, I love how all the example code is provided in ZIPs and studio links, and the uploaded slides as well. For once, I don&rsquo;t have to rely on video content! Now, if only Khan Academy transcribed each lecture into an article, without those disgusting timestamps&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="open-source-tools">Open Source Tools</h2>
<p>Both check50 and submit50, among a host of other CS50-related tools are available for offline or at least, local use, so of course, I downloaded them. Surprisingly, it was pretty painless. Big props to the CS50 team for completely open sourcing so many things - and making them multipurpose as well. It&rsquo;s easier for me to check my cases manually from the source of check50 sometimes, and I like digging around the source code.</p>
<p>check50&rsquo;s kind of reminded me that I really do need to test my code with actual unit tests, and I honestly might get started with check50 test cases for smaller scripts that I do. There&rsquo;s always pytest and unittest, but check50&rsquo;s input and output mocking seems a lot easier to get working.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> That reminds me, I should really get into TDD sometime.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a great week - <a href="https://dev.to/devteam/announcing-the-grant-for-the-web-x-dev-hackathon-winners-1nl4">winning the GFTW hackathon</a> with a super tiny project, and getting tonnes of users for <a href="https://diveintoht.ml">diveintoht.ml</a>. Oh, and also CS50 Week 0. It&rsquo;s been great. I&rsquo;ll be working on diveintoht.ml a little more, adding some more content, and that&rsquo;ll be my summer project aside from CS50. It&rsquo;s weird without school and Zoom, but I guess I&rsquo;ll try to make the best of my summer time.</p>

<p>Edit - my esteemed colleagues have reminded me that pytest and unittest both have input mocking. But then again, it&rsquo;s annoying to set up. <a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
