                <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The past three months have been hectic - from starting this blog, to <a href="https://kewbish.github.io/blog/posts/200214//">winning Google Code-in, and subsequently finding out it&rsquo;s cancelled</a>, to, of course, what everyone&rsquo;s talking about: <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019">COVID-19</a>.</p>
<p>Many countries around the world have been hit <a href="https://worldometers.info/coronavirus/">far harder</a> than Canada, but in this post, I&rsquo;d like to talk about some of the impacts, both personal and on a larger scale, that this novel coronavirus has brought.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> <em>I apologize if this post reads as a little alarmist and sad, but it reflects what I&rsquo;m thinking of right now, and I can&rsquo;t help but express that here. If you&rsquo;re going through some symptoms, call your local help line, or consult a professional for advice. One can&rsquo;t be safe enough.</em></p>
<h2 id="events-cancellations">Events Cancellations</h2>
<p>Many major events have been cancelled, including global developer conferences like <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2020/02/27/important-f8-2020-update/">F8</a>, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/qjde3m/game-developers-conference-cancelled-due-to-coronavirus-fears">GDC</a>, and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/12/coronavirus-microsoft-build-in-person-events-canceled.html">Microsoft Build</a>. I can&rsquo;t imagine what it must feel like to have spent time and money searching for, buying, and finally not being able to use their well-deserved tickets. Some of these conferences are moving online, where everyone can participate free of charge, which is an unexpected pro. It doesn&rsquo;t feel the same as a face-to-face networking session or panel, but at least it&rsquo;ll be able to reach more people this way.</p>
<p>I know I frequently humble-brag about this, but I&rsquo;m devastated that my GCI Trip got cancelled as well. We&rsquo;re being offered alternate prizes, and that makes up for some of it, but even with a videoconference (how will we arrange the times, with winners all across the globe), it doesn&rsquo;t replicate the same vibes as a four-day trip to meet new friends and bond. Seeing blurry 2MP faces through a screen, some of which will inevitably be in the middle of the night, versus cruising and Segwaying around San Francisco and Googleplex <em>just isn&rsquo;t the same</em>. As winners, we&rsquo;re left at the same level as the runners-ups, minus the chance to win and have a proper trip (if that&rsquo;ll even happen) next year.</p>
<p>Sorry about the salt. I&rsquo;m just a tad disappointed. I should stop apologizing - this is my blog after all.</p>

<p>I know it&rsquo;s not supposed to matter, but it was a once-in-a-lifetime chance that I could have had. And now it&rsquo;s gone, all because of COVID-19. Health is crucial, but even our pleas to postpone went silenced. I guess life isn&rsquo;t fair.</p>
<h2 id="economic-impacts">Economic Impacts</h2>
<p>Though the economy&rsquo;s recent un-stonks can&rsquo;t be 100% attributed directly to COVID-19, seeing the <a href="https://g.co/kgs/3vodBh">Dow Jones</a> crash has been pretty terrifying. Hearing stories of people losing thousands, and the government implementing last-minute techniques is kind of surreal.</p>
<p>I recently saw <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjfO2AKEsA8">this video by Fireship</a>:

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rjfO2AKEsA8" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>
</p>
<p>and it got me thinking about some of the future impacts. If the markets continue to fall, and demand for tech jobs drops further, I worry. I&rsquo;ll graduate university in six years, which seems like a long time. However, I&rsquo;ve been reading about the long-term effects of a recession, and I wonder if, when I enter the workforce, I&rsquo;ll be able to get a job. Apparently, the first years of your work affect your career, and how you end up in life heavily. I don&rsquo;t want my prospects to be crushed, just because I was born and left uni at an inopportune time.</p>
<h2 id="the-wrong-side">The Wrong Side</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s a known statistic: 80% of coronavirus cases have <em>mild</em> symptoms. If you contract COVID-19, you&rsquo;re likely not to die, if you&rsquo;re healthy enough. I don&rsquo;t mean to belittle anyone&rsquo;s fears, if they have existing conditions or other issues, but I find that our efforts are being focused on the wrong area.</p>
<p>The way I see it, we focus on stocking up on toilet paper, non-perishables, and talk of washing our hands. But how many of us need to? The spread of COVID-19 is through people. People.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure exactly how to prevent the spread, but staying at home, taking courses online, and generally remaining in a sterile, safe space should be fine. Travel bans seem harsh, and may lead some to lie about where they&rsquo;ve actually been, but I can&rsquo;t help but note China&rsquo;s success in quarantining and cordoning off cities and provinces.</p>
<h2 id="unexpected-pros">Unexpected Pros</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen a couple glimpses on the news that pollution levels everywhere have dramatically dropped - and the sad thing is, this is where they should be, if we&rsquo;re to meet budgets and goals. COVID-19 has had devastating impacts, but I suppose this is one of the two smaller pros.</p>
<p>The other pro I&rsquo;d like to touch on is it the fact that developers, and other members of the workforce, have started working remotely. It doesn&rsquo;t work for all, but personally, remote, self-motivated and self-guided work will always be the most productive environment for me. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m looking forward (? Should I?) to online classes. I truly appreciate the sacrifices and efforts of faculty and staff, and I sympathize with those who find that remote, online classes don&rsquo;t work well for them. I also would like to touch on the fact that for all those who work remote, there are also people who can&rsquo;t afford or don&rsquo;t have the option of working away from the office. It&rsquo;s a difficult balance, and as always, it&rsquo;ll benefit some while stranding others.</p>
<h2 id="personal-thoughts">Personal Thoughts</h2>
<p>My main reflection, through the struggles everyone&rsquo;s facing today, is how much time affects all of us. Just because I unfortunately entered <a href="https://universitytransition.ca">Transition</a> during COVID-19, just because I won <a href="https://g.co/gci">Code-in</a> in 2019-20; all this means that I&rsquo;ll be cheated out of something I was looking forward to.</p>
<p>Instead of spending my spring break out with friends (I mean, I likely wouldn&rsquo;t anyway, but let&rsquo;s pretend), I&rsquo;m self-isolating, watching the red numbers creep ever-higher, and the graphs grow exponentially.<br>
But it&rsquo;s alright. Life isn&rsquo;t fair, and life wasn&rsquo;t meant to be fair.</p>
<p>The state of the world right now is honestly scary. It feels truly like an apocalypse. Economy clinging to threads, a global pandemic sweeping across countries. And worst of all, I can&rsquo;t do more than scrub my hands and stay inside. I have to watch from my office, occasionally chatting and commiserating with my classmates online.</p>
<p>Everything changes, day by day, hour by hour. Just a couple days ago, Canada had less than a 100 cases, according to <a href="worldometers.info/coronavirus/">Worldometers</a>. Today (as of Ï€ day), we have over 250. The graphs show it all. Total active cases skyrocketing, and deaths rising to terrifying numbers.</p>
<p>What if I have a bit of a cough, a cold, perhaps even the flu? Any other time, I&rsquo;d stay home, rest up, just go through it. Now, even the slightest of symptoms sets off all the alarms. Should I go to the hospital and get tested? Can I trust these symptom charts? And even if one non-COVID-19 case decides to wait it out (rightfully), hospitals are flooded. Tests are running out, and in some countries, they&rsquo;re expensive, reducing the number of people who&rsquo;ll take them.
Is it the end of the world? There&rsquo;s no point in musing further. Just suppose we&rsquo;ll have to muster up and keep walking through life.</p>
