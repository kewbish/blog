<p>Spring break has just begun, and I&rsquo;ve decided to devote some more significant time to CPSC 110. It helps that I&rsquo;m sort of floating between projects and want a bit of bland coursework to churn through at the moment, so I&rsquo;ve been spending my leisure time listening to Kiczales go on about data and recursion. I&rsquo;ve been ramping up my progress with CPSC 110 for the last couple weeks, and I&rsquo;ve managed to do a couple &lsquo;weeks&rsquo;, or modules, since I last published a set of notes. Regarding my old end date goal, I&rsquo;ve decided to shift my goal more towards a September challenge (of the exam), to give myself time over the summer to cram and practise with old papers. (Ironically, I&rsquo;d also decided at the beginning of the year that I&rsquo;d take this summer to rest and relax before university, but I suppose that&rsquo;s gone out the window in lieu of some hopefully more engaging plans. And hey, if I choose to relax that way, I guess it&rsquo;s a perfectly fine thing to do.)</p>
<p>After getting back in the swing of Racket and relearning the templates and design recipes, these couple modules haven&rsquo;t been too challenging. Adding systematically onto the recipes makes the logical jumps between concepts less sharp, and makes the course much less intimidating. Having a repository and tracking my progress with the course has definitely motivated me to work on it more. So, here&rsquo;s a couple modules&rsquo; worth of notes - but as always, if you&rsquo;re not following along with CPSC 110 or have no interest in learning about compound and arbitrarily long data, you might want to go off and read a <a href="https://kewbi.sh/blog/posts/210307/">different post</a>.</p>
<h2 id="notes---week-3">Notes - Week 3</h2>
<p>Week 3 goes over how to define compound data (essentially adding structs to the data definition recipe), and integrates that data in building &lsquo;worlds&rsquo;, or GUI programs. Having a proper definition for data simplifies things in future weeks, and makes the data definitions seem more solid or &lsquo;real&rsquo;, in my opinion.</p>
<ul>
<li>ticks =&gt; update behaviour, but can be changed by interactive input
<ul>
<li>tick rate is defined by the program, can change</li>
<li>can use a data definition to interpret the current state</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>(big-bang)</code> function used to make these graphical programs =&gt; called worlds
<ul>
<li>import <code>(2htdp/image)</code> and <code>(2htdp/universe)</code></li>
<li>use <code>(place-image)</code> and the <code>(empty-scene)</code> frequently to draw and render</li>
<li>rendering is done by setting the <code>(to-draw)</code>, and tick behaviour by <code>(on-tick)</code>
<ul>
<li>later use <code>(on-key)</code> and <code>(on-mouse)</code> to handle those behaviours</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>start by doing a domain analysis =&gt; what remains constant and what changes each tick
<ul>
<li>each function is first wish-listed as the overall world is structured</li>
<li>apply HtDD to design the program state data =&gt; structs in second half of week</li>
<li>apply standard HtDF to create functions used in big-bang</li>
<li>use constants in the <code>(check-expect)</code>s to maximize adaptability</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>use <code>(define-struct name (args))</code> to define compound data =&gt; data that relate to each other
<ul>
<li>when expression run, generates the <code>(name?)</code>, <code>(name-args)</code>, and <code>(make-name)</code> operators</li>
<li>in HtDD example definitions and tests =&gt; now have to use <code>(make-name (args))</code>
<ul>
<li>include the data types here and intervals if using Naturals or Numbers</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>need to add interpretation for data types with the <code>;; Name is ...</code> comment</li>
<li>add interpretation for each field in HtDD interpretation comment</li>
<li>HtDD <code>(fn-for-name)</code> now includes each of the fields used in the args</li>
<li>include number of fields with the compound keyword when listing template rules used</li>
<li>when using HtDF =&gt; add constraints and notes in the tests =&gt; clarity of examples and behaviour</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>(on-mouse)</code> and the <code>(on-key)</code> events are handled with an overall cond
<ul>
<li>will take mouse event / key event as argument</li>
<li>need to check the state / key with <code>string=?</code> or <code>key=?</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>use helper functions where possible to ensure function does one thing</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="notes---week-4">Notes - Week 4</h2>
<p>In Week 4, Kiczales discusses arbitrarily sized data, which is basically a convoluted way of working with lists. This week also has to deal a lot with recursion, which is something I&rsquo;ve sort of avoided as much as possible in the past. However, it&rsquo;s been pretty interesting to see how to solve problems recursively, which I think will come in handy down the line.</p>
<ul>
<li>we use recursive data definitions to model arbitrarily sized data =&gt; compound data
<ul>
<li>set a base case (empty, or false), as well as <code>(cons)</code>&lsquo;ing it with an element and then the original data definition
<ul>
<li>this element can be atomic non-distinct data, not just another data definition (reference)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>an example of self-reference, where the data definition involves itself</li>
<li>new primitives: <code>(first list)</code> returns the first element, and <code>(rest list)</code> returns everything but the first element</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>with HtDF, several things have changed to accomodate new branches
<ul>
<li>refer to the type comment and how it refers to itself =&gt; preserve that in the function templates</li>
<li>template now needs to apply a <code>(fn-for-element)</code> for the first element
<ul>
<li>this should be another helper function generally, want the function to do one thing at a time</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>template applies the <code>(fn-for-list)</code> for the rest of the list</li>
<li>generally use a <code>(cond)</code> to check if the list is empty (base case handling)</li>
<li>examples can help clarify the behaviour of the function first, and show where you might need helpers
<ul>
<li>also insert tests for base cases themselves</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>positions in list templates matter and have their own functions
<ul>
<li>base =&gt; when the function exits and &lsquo;bottoms out&rsquo;</li>
<li>contribution of first =&gt; the first element (type checking generally goes here)</li>
<li>combination =&gt; check other cases or perform operations on the value of the rest of the list</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>when the recursive data definition handles another data definition =&gt; reference rule
<ul>
<li>produces a natural helper =&gt; abstract this to another function</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>As I write this, I&rsquo;m actually halfway through week 5, but it&rsquo;ll take me a good while to write up that double module&rsquo;s notes properly, and I&rsquo;d rather not extend this post too much. I&rsquo;m also almost at the halfway mark of the whole course (yay me!), but I&rsquo;ve noticed that most of the next modules are broken up into a and b sections, so I expect it&rsquo;ll probably be more work than the first couple weeks. I&rsquo;ve heard that the later weeks heavily build on the beginning weeks, so I might come back and update my notes posts every so often. I hope I&rsquo;ll be able to at least go through another couple weeks before spring break ends, but I also want to take enough time to relax and recharge<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>I have no big plans with regards to projects at the moment - I&rsquo;m just trying to keep everything stable before I graduate, and continue to explore opportunities I might like to take after I enter university. It&rsquo;s rather scary that I&rsquo;ll be an actual university student in a couple months, and that my quintessential &lsquo;high school experience&rsquo; is nearly over. A post about Racket is probably not the best place to digress into all the amazing experiences that&rsquo;ve filled the last couple years, but I will say it feels a bit strange to consider that I&rsquo;ll be one of &rsquo;them&rsquo; (an actual student) in the fall, and that I have no idea what I have time for left in the last three (well, two and a half, if we&rsquo;re going to be precise) months. Well, we&rsquo;ll figure it out eventually (and finish CPSC 110 somewhere in the process too).</p>
