<p>On this day, two years ago, I started this blog. The purpose? Nothing, other than to flex that I&rsquo;d just won <a href="https://g.co/gci">Google Code-in 2019</a>, and humblebrag about my tribulations along the way. I really didn&rsquo;t have anything to say back then, other than highlighting projects I&rsquo;d started, or sharing new announcements about cool things that I&rsquo;d participated in. I did a couple series early on about <a href="https://kewbi.sh/blog/posts/200621/">CS50 (Harvard&rsquo;s introductory CS course)</a> and later, <a href="https://kewbi.sh/blog/posts/201213/">CPSC110 (UBC&rsquo;s introductory CS course)</a>. I wrote in a very direct yet rambly and overly verbose tone. I wasn&rsquo;t sure what my voice was, and neither did I know what I really had to communicate.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure whether I&rsquo;ve figured out what I have to communicate now either, but I do know that I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about tools for thought and meta-writing, if that&rsquo;s a word, for the last couple months<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. This trajectory&rsquo;s focused my writing on topics that interest me more, and are more sustainable to write and share about than &lsquo;what I&rsquo;ve been up to this last week&rsquo;. Early last year, I started this phase of Yours, Kewbish with a post on <a href="https://kewbi.sh/blog/posts/210124/">hyperpersonalization</a>, which I still think might be one of my best posts. More recently, I&rsquo;ve written about <a href="https://kewbi.sh/blog/posts/210905/">the intellectual process</a>, <a href="https://kewbi.sh/blog/posts/211114/">metadata</a>, and <a href="https://kewbi.sh/blog/posts/211219/">a software culture of atomicization</a>. This sort of thing is genuinely a lot more fun to write, and encourages me to dig deep on my thoughts on where technology&rsquo;s taking this world.</p>
<p>Even at the beginning of last year, and when I wrote my <a href="https://kewbi.sh/blog/posts/210214/">last recap post</a>, I was still in a mindset of trying to pump out content and build a habit of writing. Now, it really feels like sitting down every so often just to chill and spill out some thoughts. This marks an evolution in my thinking process as well - I&rsquo;m drawing more on recurring themes that come up in my notes and general thoughts, instead of events and personal news to recap. Reading back, my posts over the past year read like one-sided nerdy soliloquies to a friend, or a transcription of me rambling to myself. I think, at least, I sound a bit more like me.</p>
<p>This post is the first half of a series about the past year of Yours, Kewbish, and of me on the internet. While the second post will touch on my personal development in the last year, this article is a combination of some raw analytics and some heartfelt reflection on the past year of blogging here. I&rsquo;m excited to consider how my thoughts have changed, and how the role of Yours, Kewbish has evolved.</p>
<h2 id="raw-content-analysis">Raw Content Analysis</h2>
<p>I wrote 26 posts in 2021, between my last recap post and today&rsquo;s. I think I unintentionally stuck quite regularly to a bi-weekly writing pattern. When I stopped forcing myself to post weekly last year, I told myself I&rsquo;d take more time to edit each post, but still take time to write each week. However, I&rsquo;ve found that I ended up in a recurring pattern of one week of scribbling down thoughts into articles and one week of stewing over other ideas. This cadence worked out well - it gave me time to let thoughts take shape while also maintaining some sort of writing habit. This tally of 26 posts is a slight decrease from 2020&rsquo;s of 40 posts, but I&rsquo;d say I&rsquo;m definitely prouder of the writing I shared last year than in 2020.</p>
<p>Diving into each individual article, I&rsquo;ve found that I&rsquo;ve solidified the structure I set out near the beginning of this blog. I&rsquo;ve since expanded the average word count from 1378 words per post to 2116 words (and for the three articles I&rsquo;ve written in 2022, 2652 words). This reflects the slower timing of my writing cycles, the fact that I now have more to say for each post, and that each article has more substance and solid thought in it. This is a welcome change from me trying to crank out a thousand words of, quite frankly, nothing every Sunday in 2020.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a graph showing the average word count per article from 2021 til now:</p>

            <p><em>Figure 1. Raw Word Count Per Article.</em></p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The solid grey dots are the word counts per article, with the dotted white line representing a 3-post rolling average. There&rsquo;s a couple high-word-count posts in the beginning of the year, then levelling down as my last term of senior year started up again. In the summer, I tended to have more time and thoughts to write about, so average word count went up. Since September of 2021, however, I see a stable trend in word count - it&rsquo;s rising so far, but I think that overall this is a plateau in word count. Though there&rsquo;s a lot of scatter in this data, especially as my sample size is small, I think the insights from this graph sum up the last year of Yours, Kewbish pretty well.</p>
<p>In the last year, I think I&rsquo;ve also changed my content topics pretty thoroughly - I&rsquo;ve picked up on some new tools for thought influences, and started engaging with a larger body of interesting reading in adjacent fields. For one, I&rsquo;ve started actually following people I find interesting and reading their posts, as well as checking in on their work. I expect that there&rsquo;ll be a lot of thinking about tools for thought, as well as more generally about software and the culture around technology.</p>
<p>To analyze this, I did a bit of poking around with my good friend Uzay&rsquo;s hot new tool <a href="https://github.com/Uzay-G/espial">Espial</a>, which analyzes your knowledge base for semantic links between concepts. It&rsquo;s a pretty cool tool, so I&rsquo;d suggest you give it a go yourself. I&rsquo;ve also recently done a bit of prototyping with Espial - I built <a href="https://github.com/kewbish/whimsy/tree/master/poke">Poke</a>. Poke uses Espial and file metadata to extract insights about what you haven&rsquo;t thought about recently. More about Poke on the GitHub, but here&rsquo;s a highlight of some of the topics I found:</p>
<ul>
<li>supply (and demand, of software)</li>
<li>zettelkasten (and its associated paradigms)</li>
<li>religion (and general cult-like behaviour around tools for thought)</li>
<li>boxing (and categorization in general)</li>
<li>anki (and spaced repetition)</li>
<li>school (and how it&rsquo;s impacted me)</li>
<li>principle (and software development practices)</li>
<li>list (and outlining as a tool for thought)</li>
<li>and, quite simply, thing (no idea)</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;d say this list lines up quite well with what I&rsquo;ve written about recently, though there is some bias against niche topics with things that I&rsquo;ve mentioned broadly many times. I also think this is an alright spread of ideas, and one that I intend to keep pursuing and thinking about this year<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Somewhat of a tangent, but it&rsquo;s also interesting to see how my voice and writing style has changed over the last year. I still have a very wordy style, but I&rsquo;d say I sound less formal and stiff. Friends that&rsquo;ve read through articles keep telling me that my writing <em>really</em> sounds like me - something I&rsquo;ll take as a compliment. Part of this probably comes from the fact that I&rsquo;m more used to writing for a (very small) audience now. I also think that this is because I&rsquo;m growing more confident in sharing my ideas. I&rsquo;ve started to be able to understand what my ideas are and what I want to say about them better. In general, I&rsquo;d think that I can communicate a bit better now, and that what I have to share is more impactful and valid.</p>
<h2 id="writing-habits">Writing Habits</h2>
<p>Besides just the content, I have a few thoughts and reflections on how I&rsquo;ve written over the past year: what I think worked well, and what I want to change. For one, I think this less frantic pace of publishing, and writing at my own pace instead of frantically trying to force ideas out, has been useful for letting more meaningful ideas come up. Having ideas that I&rsquo;m passionate about also makes me more proud of what I&rsquo;ve written, and helps make the writing process a treat, instead of a chore. I think I&rsquo;ve also done well in keeping a decent variety of influences in my work - I&rsquo;ve written about a diverse set of ideas (well, somewhat constrained by &rsquo;tools for thought&rsquo; and technology in general), and that&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;d like to continue this year. As well, last year, I wrote up a couple full series: on <a href="https://kewbi.sh/blog/posts/201213/">CPSC110</a>, on <a href="https://kewbi.sh/blog/posts/210523/">indie games</a>, and on giving my first talk at <a href="https://kewbi.sh/blog/posts/210801/">Augment Minds</a>. While I don&rsquo;t see myself connecting all my writing to a couple series, I liked the form factor of getting to explore different aspects of a topic in self-contained articles. I&rsquo;d like to do at least a couple more series this year - I already have one in the works about the idealization of tools for thought. I see that project as being a bit big in scope, so maybe I&rsquo;ll stick to just the one. Overall, however, I do like the motivation writing series gives me to finish writing pieces and think through things with different perspectives, and in seeing my ideas linked together.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I don&rsquo;t have too much I&rsquo;d like to change. I&rsquo;d mainly just like to keep up writing as a habit, and even if I don&rsquo;t publish or come up with a full piece every weekend, I&rsquo;d like to enforce a chunk of time set aside for maintaining my knowledge base and at least writing down a few new thoughts. I did really well with this during winter break earlier this year, where I&rsquo;d sit down almost every day to journal about a quirky new idea I had. With the onset of school and midterm season, however, I&rsquo;ve really let this slide. There&rsquo;s not much use beating myself up about this - my priorities, at the end of the day, are still with school. Going forward, I&rsquo;ll just try to be more accountable with myself and encourage myself to write a bit more. In addition, there&rsquo;s also stuff like exploring more literature-response or idea-response articles, where I take insights from others&rsquo; work and write about how I see them applied to what I&rsquo;m interested in. I have a couple essays-in-progress in this style, and I&rsquo;ll see how they turn out and if they&rsquo;re any good for fleshing out further.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Overall, I&rsquo;m really happy I sat down that February day two years ago to start this blog. Over the past couple years, and in the last year in particular, Yours, Kewbish has been a place where I can share my stream of consciousness. It&rsquo;s helped to spark conversations with friends, to learn how to articulate my thoughts, to gain confidence, and to let me grow as a person and developer. I find having this platform to share - no matter how half-baked my thoughts and what they&rsquo;re centering around - really valuable. Recently, I&rsquo;ve really realized the value of sharing with people, and even if no one really reads this blog, I think the act of preparing some idea to share is a big part of journey.</p>
<p>No promises, but I aim to keep writing just as much as last year for this year as well. I know school&rsquo;s going to get rough soon (midterms week is this week!), but reflecting on this blog&rsquo;s made me also realize how therapeutic it is. Among a sea of assignments where I don&rsquo;t really have entire creative license, this blog is one of the few places I can think through things in words that&rsquo;s not constrained by some rubric, implicit or explicit. That sense of creativity and, in a way, quirkiness is something that I feel that&rsquo;s gotten drained out of me throughout the last term at school. I have a couple post ideas planned, and reading week&rsquo;s coming up, so hopefully then, and each week after that as well, I&rsquo;ll find time to keep this blog simmering.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve only recently started making any prototypes to follow up with these ideas, so maybe I fall under the label of &rsquo;theory for thought&rsquo; instead of concrete tools.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>As an aside, Espial and Poke were incredibly useful for this type of overall, big-picture, general topic analysis. It was super interesting to see laid out in front of me what I&rsquo;d been thinking about extensively in the last year. It was also cool to see the differences between the topics that immediately came to mind for me that I thought I wrote about, and what the computer&rsquo;s telling me that I&rsquo;ve actually written about. Maybe the NLP isn&rsquo;t entirely accurate, and maybe I&rsquo;m subject to a recency bias, but working together, I found this to be an inspiring thought exercise.&#160;<a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
