                <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re reading this, you&rsquo;re either a) genuinely here to get the best of Kewbish content, b) someone I met through GCI and is here to stalk me, or c) a classmate, probably here to fish for blackmail. To all of you - I say hello. And goodbye, just for a bit.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve decided to move my current <a href="https://kewbish.github.io">website</a> over to <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a>, and with doing that, I can also integrate this blog directly into that repo instead. As well, it&rsquo;s been about a year since I first made my site, and I&rsquo;ve learned a lot more about design and feel that I should upgrade it. I&rsquo;m not too happy with the design of my main site, and while this blog is alright, it isn&rsquo;t consistent with my main site. It&rsquo;ll be a lot easier to manage one cohesive Kewbish look when everything&rsquo;s migrated to one place. Both sites are, as of now, going under construction, and probably won&rsquo;t have actual content for a while.</p>
<p>The past few blog posts are going to stay here as I rework my main site, but when I&rsquo;m done, I&rsquo;ll move them there. In the meantime, feel free to browse here and read whatever. My main site&rsquo;s pretty barren right now - just a placeholder and reminder about its rework, so there won&rsquo;t be much to see there. Theoretically, you can still see my site as I build it as a WIP if you dig around the URLs and GitHub repo enough, but try not to do that too much, yeah?</p>
<p>So instead of doing my homework, I&rsquo;ve decided to leave this last little note here (which will be deleted when this version of Yours, Kewbish goes down). Don&rsquo;t worry - I&rsquo;ll be back. Promise.</p>
<h2 id="currently">Currently</h2>
<p>I just finished <a href="https://diveintoht.ml">my social justice project</a>, and am just polishing up some things. I&rsquo;m waiting to promote it til I have everything down 100% and have the site tested a couple times, but if you&rsquo;d like to <em>dive into HTML</em> or check it out - feel free!<br>
Otherwise, I&rsquo;ll be working on my website. For a while. Hopefully, it won&rsquo;t be too long, but we never know.</p>

                <p class="signature">- Yours, Kewbish</p>
