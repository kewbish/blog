            <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>What&rsquo;s this <em>secret thing</em> you keep mentioning in your <a href="https://kewbish.github.io/blog/posts/200607/">blog posts</a>, you ask. Well&hellip; I&rsquo;m doing <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x">CS50x</a>. Yes, the infamous course that every &lsquo;phul istack&rsquo; developer and their friends have done. I&rsquo;m not entirely sure why I decided that doing this course was a good idea, especially trying to speedrun it in 10 weeks instead of 12. But hey, I&rsquo;d like to get more acquainted with the mysterious things known as algorithms, and I found some esteemed classmates to speedrun with me.</p>
<h2 id="cs50">CS50</h2>
<p>CS50 is Harvard (and Yale)&rsquo;s introductory course in computer science. Over 12 weeks, it covers Scratch, C, Python, SQL, and four tracks of real-life development experience. Along the way, students pick up algorithms, data structures, and time complexity - among other programming concepts. It&rsquo;s famous for being a great starter for non-programmers, and a rite of passage, almost, for other devs.</p>
<p>I definitely need to brush up on my nearly nonexistent knowledge of algorithms, and I&rsquo;ve tried to start with <a href="https://github.com/kewbish/ka-algorithms">some Khan Academy research</a>. As well, I&rsquo;d like to investigate C, even if I&rsquo;m only going to use it for this course. I&rsquo;ve heard it&rsquo;ll help build an appreciation for how high-level languages work, and even by just skimming some of the notes and starter videos, I can tell I&rsquo;ll be wishing for the sweet syntactic sugar that Python provides. I&rsquo;m also excited to learn more advanced data structures, and algorithms - and I can see the problem sets are going to be a <em>fun time</em>. Most of all, I&rsquo;m looking forward to the SQL and web part of the course, which is the track I plan on taking. I&rsquo;ve heard so much about these technologies through dev Reddits and posts, and I&rsquo;d like to see what all this RDBMS hype is all about.</p>
<p>At the end of the course, it all culminates in the <em>final project</em>. Through dev media, I&rsquo;ve found many amazing projects, and it&rsquo;s only now occurred to me that CS50 was a <em>course</em>, not some qualification or technology. The things you learn. I plan to use this final project to build my first proper full stack webapp, or at least, focus on reworking one of my older ones.</p>
<h2 id="my-expectations">My Expectations</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve skimmed through the problem sets and a couple paragraphs of the notes for now, and I have a couple of predictions for the course trajectory. First off, I can tell that Week 0 will be tedious torture, having to relearn Scratch, but I think it&rsquo;ll be relatively easy to debug. Weeks 1 - 3 seem doable with my current skillset and a couple of scrolls through StackOverflow, but I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;ll still teach me how to use better programming patterns. Weeks 4 - 5 seem like the most difficult, and this corresponds to what I&rsquo;ve read through Reddit and testimonials. The Speller problem set seems especially scary - though I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll <em>eventually</em> figure it out. Right? Week 6 is when I can finally go back to the beauty of Python, and I expect after implementing algorithms in C, I&rsquo;ll be able to macgyver a solution. Weeks 7 - end will be mostly new knowledge, but I think that my experience with HTML, CSS, and half-witted Flask attempts will come in handy.</p>
<p>I already have a cadre of classmates that I&rsquo;ll be working alongside for this journey, but I expect the past posts and resources people have created will be extremely useful. I&rsquo;ll have to be careful not to try to speedrun too much at a time, and try to sit and absorb the material properly. The data structures that I&rsquo;ve seen seem extremely useful in my pr0gramming career.</p>
<h2 id="what-else-ill-be-doing">What Else I&rsquo;ll be Doing</h2>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s almost the last year of speedrun before I enter the big bad world of <em>university</em><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, I&rsquo;m probably also going to start revising for other topics before I start school. Speedrunning was hard enough before COVID, but with COVID, the amount of class time is greatly reduced, and now we&rsquo;ll be speedrunning more than ever before. Throughout the summer, I&rsquo;ll also be revising for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Calculus, with an old book that we&rsquo;ll be using</li>
<li>Physics, with the help of a well-meaning VSB teacher that unknowingly released a bunch of helpful provincial exams on his Weebly site</li>
<li>And of course, summer homework, of which I happen to have a decent amount of. This will be fun.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="my-workflow">My Workflow</h2>
<p>I might write a separate post about this<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, but I&rsquo;ve essentially started trying to utilize Trello and other &lsquo;productivity tools&rsquo; more often, because my scatterbrained self cannot figure out how to keep a journal and development workflow together. I have an overview board, with a proper KanBan workflow, as well as some other notes. I&rsquo;m also experimenting with Zapier and IFTTT to create scheduled cards for recurring events, like my scheduled work sessions for each topic.</p>
<p>Speaking of work sessions, that&rsquo;s also another part of how I work.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> It&rsquo;s kind of like pomodoro, but with longer breaks. As everyone says - we need less screen time. Hopefully I&rsquo;ll be able to reduce the amount of break while maintaining my eye health, but y&rsquo;know, if not, that&rsquo;s fine too. I&rsquo;m trying to find ways to work offscreen, such as <em>writing by hand</em> (what a concept), but that&rsquo;s a little difficult when all my materials are onscreen and online. Oops.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Consider this CS50 Week -1. I&rsquo;ll be posting every week with recap thoughts and my review notes, but not my code. I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s legal, at least. I suppose this will be using the Feynman technique, and anyhow, you guys can read through my lack of understanding and be amused! That&rsquo;s something, at least.</p>
<h2 id="currently">Currently</h2>
<p>How did I go from 30 to 200 users on <a href="https://diveintoht.ml">diveintoht.ml</a> in <em>one day</em>. Jesus. Dev.to really helped me here - my post got 2500 views, and a bunch of people showed so much support. Apparently, a couple teachers are looking into sharing it with their classes, and people are actually <em>using it now</em>. I managed to make a much bigger impact than I expected, and I guess that&rsquo;s good! Unfortunately, now I have to actually put time and effort into maintaining, which is a good thing too, I suppose. I have a lot of ideas for content and expanding that I might add to the site, so keep checking back for updates. This will be my project for the summer along with CS50 - can&rsquo;t wait to obsess over statistics!</p>
<p>Last minute edit - It&rsquo;s 350 now, why are y&rsquo;all actually considering this a good resource. Ahh, the pressure-</p>
