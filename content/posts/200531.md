## Introduction
For the last bit, I've been working on a #gftwhackathon (Grant for the Web) submission. I've documented my progress in two [Dev.to](https://dev.to) posts, which I'll put below. This post format will be a little different, but here we go:

## But wait... what is Web Monetization?
[Web Monetization](https://webmonetization.org) is a proposed browser API (proposed, mind you. It's not an actual thing. Yet.) that supports creators through the use of micropayments. Basically, with a browser extension (right now, only available through [Coil.com](https://coil.com), but sure to change soon), consumers can stream micropayments to content creators. Right now, it supports YouTube and Twitch natively, and web developers can simply include a `<meta>` tag in their head.  

If you're interested in knowing more: check out the [Web Monetization website](https://webmonetization.org).  

But what's this *#gftwhackathon* thing I keep blathering on about?[^1]

The [GFTW Hackathon](https://dev.to/devteam/announcing-the-grant-for-the-web-hackathon-on-dev-3kd1) is an initiative partnership between Dev and the GFTW team (which is then made up of Mozilla, Coil, and Creative Commons). They're looking for ideas and proposals for their larger grant (but I'm too smol oops-).

I participated in this hackathon ~~because I'd get some merch and exposure~~ because I'd like to get more involved in the Dev.to community! As well, learning is always cool. Also - web components!  

## Halfway through GFTW!
[Original article available here.](https://dev.to/kewbish/halfway-through-gftw-200i)

Well, it's technically a bit over half, but *moving swiftly onwards*...

*What I've been working on*
I've been working on a revenue sharing library, written in vanilla Javascript.  
It'll include a `<rev-share>` element that utilizes the probabilistic revshare model outlined on the webmonetization.org site.  

It can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/kewbish/revshare) and [on NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kewbish/revshare).:

Both are still undergoing development - as I like to say, *don't scronch please*.

I'm pretty well through the project: only some bugfixes and implementing some other minor features.   
Right now, it has a pointers attribute RNG feature, and an additional exclusive revshare feature. I'm pretty happy with it - it's small, but it's mine!

I would consider myself better versed in Python than Javascript, and this was a great learning opportunity to get into Web Components. I can now see parts of what powers frameworks like Vue. As well, I familiarized myself with some more common Javascript functions, like arrow and forEach functions.  

One great resource I used during this time was the [Mozilla Web Components docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components). For some reason, the Google page was a little out-of-date regarding defining an element, and Mozilla's docs really helped me understand the lifecycle events and some best practises.  

**Journey**

I started out by researching and looking around for ideas. I was initially going to build a component library with Vue, but realized that my experience with Javascript was too limited even to build a proper component.

I then moved to thinking about vanilla Javascript, and that's what I decided on pursuing for the hackathon. Then, I started skimming docs, and started building for real! That's mostly what I've been doing for the last weeks (though I had a computer problem that delayed me for weekend.)

I look forward to finishing up, and submitting the project! This hackathon was super fun to work with, and reading everyone's posts about their projects was also very inspiring.  

This was also my first post on Dev! My blog is undergoing some construction right now, so I'll try to post / crosspost more frequently here in the meantime.

## Revshare.js - a Revshare Web Component
[Original article available here.](https://dev.to/kewbish/revshare-js-a-revshare-web-component-1c1p)

**What I built**
I went through a bunch of ideas - a Vue component library, implementing this in another site, or adding it to my existing sites.  
Eventually, I settled on this idea, and for the entire month of May (minus an OS reinstall and plus tonnes of Google searching), I spent some time exploring Web Components and Javascript!  

I've built [Revshare.js](https://github.com/kewbish/revshare), a small Javascript library to make revsharing with Web Monetization easier. It provides an interface for a `<rev-share>` element with a pointers attribute to make probabilistic revsharing easier.  

**Submission Category:**
Foundational Technology

**Demo**
Add a `<script src="http://unpkg.com/@kewbish/revshare"/>` tag to your head, and that's all you need to get started.  

```html
...
<rev-share pointers='["$jackie.wallet": 60, "$charlie.wallet": 40]'>
    <p>This is your revshared content!</p>
</rev-share>
...
``` 

If you'd also like to make your `<rev-share>` element exclusive, just add the `exclusive` attribute as well. (This will hide the element when Web Monetization is not enabled.)  

```html
...
<rev-share pointers='["$jackie.wallet": 60, "$charlie.wallet": 40]' exclusive>
    <p>This is your revshared, exclusive content!</p>
</rev-share>
...
```
It works using probabilistic revsharing, and the [docs I used as a guideline are available here](https://webmonetization.org/docs/probabilistic-rev-sharing).

**Link to Code**
The project is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/kewbish/revshare), [on NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kewbish/revshare), and [on UnPkg](http://unpkg.com/@kewbish/revshare).

**How I built it**

This is built with the basic Web Components API. This was also my first proper Javascript project, and a great learning experience.  
I was a bit confused with all the callbacks available, and when exactly they fired. The Mozilla Docs were super useful in this case.  

If you'd like to see what else I've posted regarding the GFTW hackathon:

**Additional Resources/Info**
There are a couple other Web Component submissions that also add Web Monetization functionality - go check those out!

If you have any feedback, let me know! (I'm a complete newbie with Javascript - be gentle `:)`.)

## Conclusion
I'm not sure how this post even reads. Isn't it just copypasta? Why am I even attempting to put more content here? Does anyone read this?  

Anyway, I'm trying to get more *involved*, as I've said before, and start becoming the epic social media influencer I wish to become. (That was a joke. I promise.) I've heard from *so many people* that I'm supposed to build a blog and make technical blog posts for more reach and to build a platform.[^2] [^3]

## Currently
I'm working on rewriting Opus in Flask and Vue (private repo, I don't need more people scronching me because I'm bad at Flask) right now. Soon, I, too, will be able to call myself a 'full-stack developer'! ('Soon' is relative. It's probably going to be a long long time.) I've been using PyMongo and MongoDB, which I'm not sure is the best choice given my data structure, but is a lot easier for my JSONified brain to understand. (I've built too much stuff with Hugo's data-driven features.)  

I have some *interesting* plans for the summer. More about that soon. (If I remember to do so.)

[^1]: 1. I feel like I've been sounding more and more British. Do I sound British? I have no clue anymore. Someone British please tell me-

[2]: 2. Don't think that quite worked; the entirety of readership of this blog is currently only reading through for things to meme me about.  

[3]: 3. TL;DR: I have no clue what I'm doing but apparently crossposting blog posts is supposed to boost SEO and reach and apparently that's a cool thing to do so here I am-
