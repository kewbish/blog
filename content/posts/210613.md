## Introduction
The other day, I was looking through old backups and archives, and found a couple interesting folders. Here's a look at what eleven-year-old me thought was peak indie game development:

In this post, I'd like to reflect on some of my past projects and other aspects of my past game dev journey, such as the various communities and influences that somehow combined to build my aesthetic. This is a continuation of my last post: if you're interested, I discussed some of the [tools and engines](https://kewbi.sh/blog/posts/210523/) I used back then.

## Itch.io Inspiration
- joining the discord server
- seeing other games and concepts

## Indie Game Charm

## The Game Jam Grind
- even thought i never made anything

## Experiments and Examples
Let's just look at some of my Unity games, made a couple years ago, sometime before the end of 2018.

I liked making proof of concepts, toying around with environments and game mechanics, instead of worrying about gameplay. It helped me learn how to work through design problems, and piece together how to create simple interactive environments.

## Conclusion

=== outline ===
- Itchio inspiration and seeing other games and concepts, the discord server
- Game jam grinding even though I never made anything
- Some examples of what I used to make => little experiments and one-scene wonders
	- Liked playing with the concepts and making proof of environments not worrying about gameplay
	- learning to actually code
